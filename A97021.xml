            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>To know nothing but Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>] Not that <hi>Paul</hi> contemned all other knowledg and humane learning in Arts and Sciences wherein himſelfe was ſo accompliſht, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great Doctor of the Gentiles, and could ſpeak tongues more then they all; but ſo farre as it ſtood in competition, oppoſition, or compariſon of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt and winning ſoules unto him.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:170650:17"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Among you</hi>] Even you though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe learned Corinthians, yet you have not ſufficiently learned Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And him crucified</hi>] That is, ſuffering upon the Croſſe, and dying for us; As if he ſhould ſay; I know preaching of Chriſt crucified is to the Jews a ſtumbling block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſſe, but to us that are ſaved, the power of God and wiſdome of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18. As if he ſhould have ſaid, all knowledge is excellent, of all knowledge, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt is more excellent; of all knowledge of Chriſt, the knowledge of Chriſt crucified is moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, moſt ſweet moſt comfortable. <hi>God forbid</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul, that I ſhould rejoyce in any thing, but in the Croſſe of Chriſt;</hi> why in the Croſſe of Chriſt rather then in his Crown; in Chriſt crucified, rather then glorified?</p>
               <p>Certainly, 1. becauſe it argues greater love in Chriſt to be crucified, then to be glorified for us. 2. Becauſe though hee makes <hi>application</hi> as glorified, yet he made <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> as crucified.</p>
               <p>Thus you have ſeen the meaning of the words, from whence diverſe concluſions might be gathered, yet I will inſiſt onely upon one, which I conceive cheifly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:170650:18"/>
               <p>Doct. <hi>The great leſſon which every<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one ought eſpecially to ſtudy and learne, is, to know Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This indeed ſeemes an old leſſon, yet it alwayes brings forth new fruit <note n="c" place="margin">Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per novu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſit, quod ſemper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficit ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, Nec unquam patietnr veteraſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re quod ſemper nos facit fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctificare.</note>; who can be weary of preaching, or learning Chriſt? <hi>Dulce nomen Chriſti,</hi> ſweet is the name of Chriſt, at leaſt to every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that hath his part in him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſeemes a plaine leſſon which every body almoſt knowes alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, fit to be taught children, whom we aske what is Jeſus Chriſt? But it is ſuch a leſſon as would beſeeme the greateſt Angel in heaven ſtill to learne, and indeed which the very Angels ſtill deſire to ſtudy and look into, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. and are ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this day.</p>
               <p>It was the deſire and ſtudy of <hi>Paul</hi> ſtill to know Chriſt, <hi>Phil. 3. 10. That I may know him;</hi> Did not <hi>Paul</hi> know Chriſt already? yes ſurely, farre better then we; yet he would faine know him better, and ſee more into the love of Chriſt which is ſo unſpeakable, as if the holy Ghoſt wanted words to expreſſe it, <hi>John 3. 16.

               <p>And further, as our Lord Chriſt is man, he is the ſon of God, but not by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor adoption, nor eternall generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by hypoſtaticall union, namely by prerogative of his perſonall union: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Feliciani,</hi> that called Chriſt in his humane nature the adopted ſonne of God.</p>
               <p>And thus the Son of God became the

               <p>And what greater love could the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhew unto us then to give his deare Son, his beloved Son, his only begotten ſon for us? Joh. 3. 16.

There was one had foure ſons, who in a famine being ſore oppreſſed with hunger, the Parents reſolved to ſell one for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; But then they conſidered the eldeſt, was the firſt of their ſtrength, therfore loth to ſell him, the ſecond was the very pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the father, the third was like the mother, the fourth and the youngeſt was the childe of their old age, their <hi>Benjamin,</hi> the dearly beloved of them both, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were reſolved not to part with any of them, and ſo would rather ſuffer themſelves to periſh, then to part with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their children.</p>
               <p>Another had two ſons, both were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to dye, yet upon mediation the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was offered to have one ſpared; But he could not find in his heart which to chuſe to live, &amp; ſo to leave the other to the ſtroak of death (They both were ſo dear to him) and ſo they both died; ſo dear are

               <p>Thirdly that Ieſus Chriſt is God, <hi>The mighty God</hi>

And now he is a true man in heaven, the ſame that he was on earth though glorifyed, contrary to the hereſy of the Seleucians that affirmed that Chriſt in his aſſention unclothed himſelfe of the fleſh of man, and left it in the glob of the Sun.

               <p>O infinite wonder, That God ſhould pleaſe to chuſe one man among all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, (or more properly humane nature) and exalt him to be one of the Trinity, to ſit in the ſeate of God, be called God, adored and worſhipped as God to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.<note place="margin">Not <hi>car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> A briefe view of the ſufferings of Chriſt before he ſuffered on the Croſſe.</head>
               <p>SEcondly, we muſt ſtudy to know Chriſt in his crucifixion or in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; <hi>And him crucified:</hi> All his life was a crucifixion, from the womb to the tomb, from his birth to his buriall; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, though little can be ſaid by way of explication more then is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy largely related in the Hiſtory of the Goſpel; yet give me leave for method ſake to-give you a breife view of them.</p>
               <p>He was crucified, 1. In his concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in that he was conceived of the ſeed of the Virgin, and lodged in her narrow womb, whom the heavens could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and did not abhorre the Virgins womb.</p>
               <p>But this was was to ſweeten our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception who are conceived in ſinne and born in iniquity.</p>
               <p>2. He was crucified in his birth, in<note place="margin">Pſal. 51 5.</note> that he was borne of a woman, the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the creature, he that made her was born of her; yea of a poore maid, offering two Turtle Doves for her purifying, as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170650:25"/> being not able to bring a Lamb according to the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 12. 8.</p>
               <p>Was there never a great Lady in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> for this great Prince of heaven and earth to be borne of? <hi>But he looked on the lowlineſſe of his handmaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this teacheth us that Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 26.</note> not the rich, no more then the poor; that he came for the poore; poore <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> lay in rich <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, when rich <hi>Dives</hi> was in hell torments. Poore Shepherds had Chriſt revealed to them by Angels, when he was hid from the<note place="margin">Matth. 18. 10.</note> great ones and Rulers at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who can then deſpiſe the pooreſt Saint? who perhaps may have move of Chriſt in him, and a higher ſeat in glory then our ſelves; A pearl is rich when found on a dung-hill, though it may gliſter more when ſet in a Ring of Gold. Hath not God choſen the poore of this world to be rich in faith, and heires of that Kingdome? <hi>James</hi> 2. 5.</p>
               <p>3. In that he was born in a ſtable, <hi>Luke 2. 12. This ſhall be a ſigne unto you;</hi> And well they had this ſigne, for elle its likely they would have looked into the faireſt houſes, ſtatelieſt chambers, and not in a ſtable for him.</p>

               <p>Yet all this was for our exaltation; Chriſt was clothed with clouts and raggs, that we might be clothed with Robes of glory; Chriſt was laid in a Manger that we might have manſion-places in heaven, and lie in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome.</p>

               <p>But all this was for our exaltation; for 1. he was crowned with thornes, that we might be crowned with a crowne of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; <hi>Doe men gather grapes of thornes?</hi> yet the bloud of Chriſts thornes, was the bloud of our grapes.</p>
               <p>2. He had a reed in his hand, to teach

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> The ſufferings of Chriſt at and upon the Croſſe.</head>
               <p>HAving finiſhed the ſufferings of Chriſt in his life, we now come to his ſuffering in his death on the Croſſe in theſe words, <hi>And him crucified] For greater love (ſaith Chriſt) hath no man, then this, that a man lay downe his life for his freinds,</hi> John 15. 13. If as the Jewes dream he had come as a great Monarch, had trod on nothing but Crownes and Scepters, and the necks of Kings, and had had the Potentates of the earth to attend his traine, it had beene great love to us: Yea it had beene ſome love if he had onely pitied us in our miſery, and wept for us, as <hi>David</hi> did for <hi>Abſalom:</hi> Or if he had pleaded for us, and ſpake a good word for us, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> did for <hi>David:</hi> Or if he had ſent an Angel for us: Or if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe had ſuffered diſgrace, reproaches,<note place="margin">Cant. 2, 5.</note> opprobryes, &amp;c. <hi>But greater love he could not ſhow, then to dye for us: skin for skin, and all that a man hath will be give to ſave his life;</hi> yet Chriſts life was not too dear
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170650:30"/> for us; the ſpouſe indeed was ſick of love, but Chriſt exceeded her, for he died for love. This is our Pellican that hath nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and fed us with his bloud. Many mothers can endure crying of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and bearing them with paine, that would hardly dye for them; but the love of Chriſt paſſed the love of women, for he dyed for us.</p>
               <p>Yea greater love had Chriſt towards us then barely to dye for us, in three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. 1. A man may dye for another,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Codrus</hi> for the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </note> if perhaps it be an honourable death, to get renoune after his death, as ſome of the heathens have done. 2. If it be an eaſie death. 3. If it be for a dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved freind to whom he hath been much ingaged: <hi>Scarcely for a righteous man will one dye ſaith Paul,</hi> that is, that hath lived juſtly: <hi>Yet for</hi> a <hi>good man</hi> (that hath beene very beneficiall to him) <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure one would even dare to dye;</hi> and<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 8.</note> yet it is but a peradventure neither.</p>
               <p>But firſt, Chriſt died not an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable death, the people applauding him, as they did ſometimes the Martyrs; But the <hi>ſhamefull</hi> death of the Croſſe, <hi>Heb. 12. 2. He endured the Croſſe, and deſpiſed the ſhame.</hi> Now diſhonour and ſhame to a noble ſpirit is as bitter as death it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170650:31"/> ſelfe; And ſurely if to live with infamy be worſe then death, what is it then to dye with infamy?</p>
               <p>It was ſhamefull in five reſpects.</p>
               <p>1. In that they made him carry his owne Croſſe, or gallowes whereupon he was hanged, as when malefactors go with halters about their necks to execution.</p>
               <p>2. It was ſhamefull, in that he was<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 19. 23.</note> ſtript naked to the ſcorne of Angels and men; even he that covers the heavens with ſtarres, the earth with flowers, the beaſts with skins, and men with raiment, even he was ſtript naked (ſo farre as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty would permit ſay ſome) and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed<note place="margin">Rev. 3. 17. 18.</note> onely with his own innocency. To teach us we are naked of all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and deſerve to be ſtript naked of all comforts, earthly and ſpirituall; And that he might cloath us with the robes of his righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>3. It was ſhmeful, in that he was hang'd; a death meet for theeves, murtherers and execrable ſinners; we count it a death too baſe for noble bloud, although they turn traytors, and therefore they have liberty to exchange the gallowes for the block.</p>
               <p>To ſee a King hang'd, what a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſuffering were it? but for God to be hang'd on a gallowes much more.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:170650:31"/>
               <p>The Turks mock us at this day with our crucified God: and ſome of the heathens ſaid they would not beleeve in a hang'd God; But the greater his ſufferings were, the greater was his love, and our miſery, who deſerved to hang in hell for ever.</p>
               <p>4. It was ſhamefull, in that he was hanged with two theeves, and in the midſt as the Prince of theeves and murtherers, and as the greateſt malefactor, <hi>Eſay 53. 12. He was numbred among the tranſgreſſour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> His good name was as deare to him as ours to us; Now which of us, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being innocent, could be content to be eſteemed as murtherers, adulterers, theeves, or the like? Yet perhaps this might figure out the laſt judgement when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant ſinners ſhall be ſet on the right hand, and the reprobates on the left (as one obſerveth *) the one ſort to be ſaved,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>John Heyward</hi> knight.</note> the other to be condemned.</p>
               <p>5. It was ſhamefull, becauſe he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted over in his miſery, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> was mocked by the Philiſtines at his death; <hi>he ſaved others, ſaid they, but cannot ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; Come drwne from the Croſſe and wee will beleeve in thee. All that ſee me laugh me</hi>

                  <hi>to ſcorne, they ſhoot out the lip, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, as Chriſt died not an honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble death, ſo he ſuffered not an eaſie, but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170650:32"/> a moſt bitter and painfull death; he was<note place="margin">Phil. 2. Heb. 12. 2.</note> obedient to death, <hi>even to the death of the Croſſe, he endured the Croſſe.</hi> This appeares even in what he ſuffered from men in his body (which yet was leſſe then what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Martyrs ſuffered being rouled naked in a barrel of nailes, racked, burned, &amp;c.)</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>before he was laid upon the Croſſe.</hi> They gave him <hi>gall and vinegar to drink,</hi> as <hi>Matthew</hi> reads it, <hi>Matthew</hi> 27. 34. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> (one explaines the other) That is, wine as ſharp as vinegar, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered with mirh like gall, but not gall it ſelfe (as <hi>Beza</hi>) Or rather I think it was mingled with both gall and mirh (as <hi>Gerard.</hi>) Some indeed think this no part of his ſufferings, and that it was not to torment him, but <hi>ut mors ejus eſſet ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerior,</hi> ſo <hi>Calvin:</hi> And <hi>Beza</hi> thinks the good women brought the wine to chear him, and that it was <hi>Vinum dulce</hi> ſweete<note place="margin">

               <p>And this was to teach us that our cup ſhould have been gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood to all eternity; but Chriſt hath drunk the cup of wormwood and gall, that we might drink the cup of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>3. His armes being ſtretched out, they nailed him by the hands, bearing the weight of his own body and then they nailed his feet to the foot of the croſſe, and ſo taking up the croſſe with this bloudy ſacrifice upon it, probably they ſet it down into the earth (or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe making it faſt) thereby exceedingly rending the wounds &amp; ſhaking his body.</p>

                  <hi>They pierced my hands and feet, or Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-like tore they them,</hi> as the text with the marginall note reads it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 17. and<note place="margin">

               <p>And more they would have done but could not being dead already; only one out of deſparate malice, runs at him and thruſts his ſpeare into his heart to be ſure to kill him, and make his death to be without queſtion.</p>
               <p>But thus was Chriſts heart wounded, that our hearts might be <hi>eaſed</hi> and <hi>cheared.</hi> For from thence came water and bloud, (the <hi>pericardium</hi> about the heart, having a little bagge of water to coole it, which they pierced) to ſignify he would be to us both <hi>water</hi> and <hi>bloud,</hi> both Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſanctification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30.</p>

If wee could ſcourge out rivers of bloud, out faſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> glaze our eyes with teares, naile them to heaven with devotion, weep a ſea of tears, yea of bloud; Should we pray never ſo much (yea weare out our knees in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) read never ſo much the Word of God and other good books, heare never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſermons, refraine from all groſſe ſins, build Hoſpitals, give all our goods to the poore, and our bodies to be burned; yet can we not make God ſatisfaction thereby or obtain ſalvation, <hi>Mich. 6. 8. 1 Cor.</hi> 13. 1. 2 Nay.

               </p>
               <p>Its true, Chriſtians may look to their
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170650:36"/> graces as evidences of their part in Chriſt and ſalvation (and the clearer they are, the greater will be their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort) but not as cauſes; They may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe make uſe of duties as meanes to bring them to Chriſt and ſalvation, but not to be ſaved by them: As the Dove made uſe of her wings to fly to the Ark, but truſted not in her wings, but in the Arke. Suppoſe thoſe that were ſtung with fiery ſerpents, had uſed any other remedies or medicines to cure the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, beſides looking upon the brazen ſerpent, had they not been of no value? Or as thoſe that in the time of <hi>Noahs</hi> flood truſted to their own houſes, the higheſt trees or mountains, or any other thing beſides the Ark, were they not all drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? ſo muſt they all periſh that expect ſalvation by any other name, but only by the name of Ieſus Chriſt, whether Turks, Iews, Pagans, Papiſts, ignorant and civill perſons among our ſelves, or whoever.</p>
               <p>2. As we are to believe there is no ſalvation out of Chriſt, ſo we are to know that Chriſt is a ſufficient Saviour, <hi>to ſave</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>perfectly thoſe that come to him and truſt in him;</hi> from theſe two grounds.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe he hath perfectly fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170650:36"/> the law for us, whereby we ſtand as<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 17. 2 Cor. 5. 21. Rom. 5 19.</note> righteous in the ſight of God, as Chriſt was for us; and God accepteth of us as if we had fulfilled the law in our owne perſons.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, becauſe he hath fully ſatisfied the wrath of God for all our ſins and pacified him towards us, as if we had never ſinned, or as if we our ſelves had ſuffered for them in hell for ever, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. blotting out the hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ordinances againſt us, ſo as now nothing can be read againſt us.</p>
               <p>And this appeares by his reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and ſitting at the right hand of God, in his glory, triumphing over all his enemies, which were not for ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, but to make <hi>application</hi> of our redemption, &amp; for <hi>teſtification</hi> of the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of his ſatisfaction. Hence ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> it is <hi>Chriſt that died,</hi> yea <hi>Rather</hi> that is riſen<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 34.</note> again, thereby ſhewing the ſufficiency of his death, that God is ſatisfied, and all is finiſhed.</p>
               <p>Nay certainly Chriſt hath ſatisfied God more abundantly for us, then if we our ſelves had gone to hell for ever, <hi>for we had been but alwaies ſatisfying, and God had not been fully ſatisfied, but in Chriſt he is fully and for ever ſatisfied,</hi> ſo
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170650:37"/> as now we may plead pardon not only from mercy but from righteouſneſſe and juſtice it ſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 15. 16.</p>
               <p>So then we muſt conclude that Chriſts <hi>ſatiſpaſſion</hi> is our <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> (as <hi>Luther</hi> pleaſeth to call it, for by Chriſt crucified we are juſtified; and if the leaſt of his ſufferings were <hi>meriti infiniti,</hi> of infinite<note place="margin">Non mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riendo <hi>Greg.</hi> Sine Chriſti ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventu. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſ.</hi> Minima Chriſti poena.

               <p>And truly there is nothing more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull to mortifie ſinne then the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and meditation of the ſufferings of Chriſt. If one ſhould kill our father, would we hug and embrace him as our friend? let him eate at our table? and not rather hate and deteſt the very ſight of him, and ſeek to be revenged of him? If a Snake ſhould ſting thy dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſpouſe to death, wouldſt thou preſerve it alive? warme it at the fire? hug it in thy boſome? and not rather ſtob it with a thouſand wounds? And were not our ſinnes the cauſes and inſtruments of Chriſts death? Were not they the whips that ſcourged him? the nayles, the cords, the ſpeares, the thornes that wounded him, and fetcht his heart bloud from him? And can we love our ſinnes that kild our Saviour? Can a ſpouſe love
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170650:44"/> her husband, and her heart embrace an adulterer. We complaine of the ſinne of <hi>Judas</hi> and of the Jewes, and ſeeme to hate them, and ſpit at the mention of them: and can we love our <hi>Judas ſins</hi> that ſet them all on work, and put Chriſt to death?</p>
               <p>And certainly he knowes nothing of Ieſus Chriſt ſavingly, as the <hi>truth is in Jeſus that hath not put off the old man, which is corrupt according to deceitfull luſts.</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Eph. 4. 21. 22.</note> Though not totally, yet abating the love and power of them daily, as a man wounded mortally daily weakens; Or as a tree cut at the root daily withers by little and little; or as a dead man in the grave daily rots, ſtinks and waſts; for ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, by our rejoycing in Chriſt I die daily.</hi>

Now the reaſon why the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt and him Crucified is ſo excellent; Is, becauſe it hath a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and higher revelation then the knowledge of all other things; <hi>Adam</hi> had knowledge of the creatures by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inſtinct, yea and of God too; but had not the leaſt <hi>ſcintillas</hi> of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt. <hi>Plato</hi> by light of nature wrote of God the Creator, but could not write a word of Chriſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; and the reaſon is, becauſe wee may ſee ſomething of God a Creator in the Creature, but all the frame of heaven and earth could not bring the leaſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt a Redeemer: But this knowledge came by ſpeciall revelation immediately from God <note n="e" place="margin">1 Col. 1. 26.</note> and therefore is eſpecially to be inquired after, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 7. We ſpeake the myſtery of God, even the hidden wiſdome which God ordained before the world to our glory.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> the knowledge of Chriſt is the moſt excellent knowledge, becauſe the excellency of all other knowledge is included ſuper-eminently in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt; as the brightneſſe and beauty of all the Starres appeare in the Sunne.</p>
               <p>And this appeares in theſe five reſpects.</p>
               <p>1. The excellency of the knowledge of God appeares in the knowledge of Chriſt. 2. The ſweetneſſe of the word conſiſts in the revelation of Chriſt. 3. The knowledge of all the workes of God are not ſo excellent as the knowledge of Chriſt. 4. The excellency of man is that he knoweth Chriſt. 5. The excellency of the workes of man are, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from man indued with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt I ſay, the ſweetneſſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the knowledge of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe appeares in the knowledge of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>light of the knowledge of the glory of God ſhines in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
               <p>And this appeares in three particulars.</p>
               <p>1. In regard of his perſon: for he is <hi>the image of the inviſible God,</hi> the print of<note place="margin">1 Col. 1, 15</note> the face of God is ſeen in him, even the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170650:47"/> holineſſe, goodneſſe, mercy, &amp;c. and all the attributes of God did ſhine in his ſonne in a ſuper-eminent manner, (and that <hi>in carne viſibili, in viſible fleſh</hi>) even as the Moone reſembles the Sun, or as ſome times the child is the very picture of the Father; So that Chriſt might truly ſay, he that hath ſeen the ſonne hath ſeen the father, becauſe he hath ſeen the attributes of the father ſhining in the ſonne. And hence he is ſtiled the brightneſſe or luſter<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> of his fathers glory, and the Character or expreſſe image of his perſon. (<hi>g</hi>)</p>
               <p>Secondly, in regard of the worke of Redempt ion, wh in all the attributes of God ſhine forth more gloriouſly then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they would have done if Chriſt had not redeemed us: As the glory of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to find out ſuch a way to ſave man by uniting God and man together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33, which the wit of men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels<note place="margin">Pſa. 85. 10.</note> could never have found out: The glory of his holineſſe and juſtice againſt ſin, that rather then ſin ſhall not go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, his owne ſonne ſhall be puniſhed. The glory of his mercy, goodneſſe and<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 16</note> love, that rather then man ſhall dye, his own ſonne ſhall ſuffer for us; he ſhall dye that we may live: he ſhall be crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we may be glorified. The glory
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170650:47"/> of his power, that he is able to bring life out of death, to fetch hony out of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Carkaſſe, and to ſupport mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to <hi>beare ſuch infinite wrath.</hi> And hence it is when Chriſt was borne, that the Angels came out of heaven, ſinging, and rejoycing, ſaying, <hi>Now Glory to God on</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 2. 14</note> 
                  <hi>high.</hi> As if God had never the like glory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed before, no not in the work of the whole Creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; certainly if we had ſtood in innocency we could never have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived God, ſo juſt and ſevere againſt ſin, ſo merciful and loving to let his own ſon ſuffer to ſhew mercy to us, &amp;c. as now we ſee he is in our redemption by Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3. But thirdly, and eſpecially the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the knowledge of God appeares in the knowledge of Chriſt in relation to us: Becauſe to know God without Chriſt, is to know him our enemy, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging God, a conſuming fire which makes us feare and tremble to thinke of God; As it is with the Divels, and was with <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, he ran from God, as his greateſt enemy.</p>
               <p>But to know God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt is ſweet and comfortable. This is <hi>life eternall</hi> to know thee the onely true God and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe now we know
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170650:48"/> God, to be our God, our mercifull, loving, gracious, and reconciled father which is in heaven; that now we can with <hi>open face,</hi> and not like Trayrors, with our <hi>faces cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> behold <hi>the glory of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Moſes</hi> could with delight ſee God paſſe by in all his Royalty and glory when he was hid in the Rock; ſo Gods attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes ſhining out of the Rock Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, are ſweet and lovely to us (<hi>that Rock was Chriſt.</hi>)</p>
               <p>For now, if I know God to be a wiſe God that knowes all things that are done on earth, <hi>the greater is my comfort,</hi> for then he is the more able to know what I want, and to take care of me.</p>
               <p>Is he a holy God? The better for me, becauſe then he is the more able to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy me. <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 1. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Is he a juſt God? The better for me, for then he muſt needs pardon me, ſeeing Chriſt his own ſonne hath dyed for me, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33.</p>
               <p>Is he very mercifull? Then he will ſpare me, and take pity upon me. <note n="b" place="margin">Mal. 3. 17. Pſa. 130. 34. Pſal. 103.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Is he loving and amiable in his diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Then he will take pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in me.</p>
               <p>Is he ſtrong, mighty and powerfull?
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170650:48"/> then he is the more able to defend me from my greateſt and ſtrongeſt enemies. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 31.</p>
               <p>Is he a rich God, that hath all things in heaven and earth? the better for me, for then he is the more able to provide for me what ever I ſtand in need of, becauſe God is my God reconciled to me, and all that is in God is for me.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, out of Chriſt the thoughts of God are terrible to us, we look upon him as our greateſt enemy; As the Devils that look upon God out of Chriſt, they beleeve &amp; tremble; Or as a ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ve that looks upon his cruell maſter, or as a foule felon upon a ſevere Iudge: <hi>I knew ſaid the evill ſervant, thou waſt an hard man.</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe all the attributes of God are now againſt him. <hi>All this is againſt me, ſaith</hi> Iacob. <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 42. 36.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Is he a wiſe God? the worſe for me, for then he is more able to find out my ſins, and knowes all the wickedneſſe my heart is privy to. <note n="d" place="margin">Jer. 17. 9</note>
               </p>
               <p>Is he holy? then he muſt needs hate, me, that am ſo filthy <note n="e" place="margin">Hab. 1. 13</note>
               </p>
               <p>Is he juſt? the worſe for me, for then he muſt needs puniſh me, and be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on me for my ſins.</p>
               <p>Is he an almighty powerfull God?
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170650:49"/> then how eaſie is it for him at his pleaſure to break me in pieces, to grind me to powder, and to conſume me in his wrath, who am in his hands but as a veſſell of clay in the hands of the potter, as chaffe before the wind, or as ſtubble before the fire?</p>
               <p>Is he full of love, mercy and pity? O that's my greateſt miſery, becauſe I may<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 28</note> 
                  <hi>ſee</hi> it extended to others, but I ſhall never taſte a drop of his mercy; as <hi>Dives</hi> could not have a drop of <hi>water to coole his tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that we ſee, it were good for ſuch a man that there were no God, or that he had never known him, and might never ſee his face, if he knowes him not in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2 Secondly the ſweetneſſe of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the word of God conſiſts in this, that Ieſus Chriſt is revealed in it; for elſe it were the moſt dreadfull book to us that ever was opened, like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> roule, that was written within and without nothing but mourning, lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and woe; Or like <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riahs</hi> letter: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ſentence of our own condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>The morall law, the very image of God, and likeneſſe of his nature, which is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170650:49"/> ſo holy, righteous, juſt, and good: yet it ſeems like <hi>Draco's</hi> lawes, that were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with blood, even a law of death, terror, and condemnation, <note n="g" place="margin">Gal. 3. 10</note> any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then it is a ſchoolemaſter to drive us to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The ceremoniall law as Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, Paſſeover, water out of the rock, the brazen ſerpent, cities of refuge, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, waſhings, ſacrifices, offerings. What ſweetneſſe or goodneſſe was in them any further, then they did typify Chriſt? Alas, they were but as dry ſhels, Chriſt was the kernell: they were but as ſo many glaſſes, but Chriſt was the faire face that was ſeen in them; they were but as ſhadows, but the body was Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
               <p>And the Goſpel, the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament is nothing elſe but Chriſt in every leafe, and how to walke in him; As Count <hi>Anholt</hi> that Princely Preacher was wont to ſay, The Scriptures (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Goſpel) they were but the ſwath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bands of the child Ieſus.</p>
               <p>And certainly, if the word be the <hi>field,</hi> Chriſt is all the <hi>treaſure</hi> that is hid in that<note place="margin">D. <hi>Stough. ton.</hi>
                  </note> field; Or as a worthy and famous divine once of this City ſaid, If all the word of God be like a ring of Gold, yet Chriſt is the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170650:50"/> Pearle in that Ring of Gold.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, the knowledge of Chriſt is ſweeter and more excellent then the knowledge of all creatures, and things that God hath created in heaven or earth; indeed all knowledge is excellent, even of the meaneſt creatures; which all men and women naturally affect, as we ſee in <hi>Eve</hi> that would adventure the loſſe of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe to gaine more knowledge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6. Even the plough-man learnes to plough and ſow his ground by inſtinct from God, <hi>Eſaiah</hi> 28. 26.</p>
               <p>And what paines do men ſtill take to get knowledge of the creatures? as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomers, Philoſophers, Geographers, &amp;c? Yea, how do we admire the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heathens? the wiſdome of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> that could diſcourſe from the Cedar to the ſhrub? And a man of excellent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> parts and deep learning, how is he honoured of all men?</p>
               <p>But alas, what is all his knowledge and learning without the knowledge of Chriſt? It is but of the creature; He can tel you the nature of a Starre, of a bird, of a beaſt, fiſhes, &amp;c. He can diſcourſe of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and nations, &amp;c. when perhaps a poore milke-maid can tell what Chriſt is better then he; &amp; is it not better to know
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170650:50"/> what Chriſt is, then to know what a ſtar, a tree, a fiſh, a bird, or a beaſt is, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creature?</p>
               <p>Nay; ſuppoſe the knowledge of the creature may lead thee to the knowledge of God, as indeed it doth: For the <hi>inviſible things of God are ſeen by the Creation of the world, even his eternall power and God head,</hi> Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, 1. 18 Yea, what is al the world created, but God explained?

For <hi>Quibus machinis? quae ferramenta</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:170650:51"/> ſaid the heathens? What engines, what Iron tooles &amp;c. could be made uſe of, in the framing this goodly ſtructure? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly none; Neither yet could they come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, neither could men make them, no more then birds or beaſts could make ſtately buildings in a glorious Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>But alas, if they ſhould bring thee to the knowledge of God, yet they can never bring thee to the knowledge of Chriſt: and then the knowledge even of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe will be uncomfortable.</p>
               <p>So that we may truly ſay with <hi>Calvin;</hi> All knowledge makes us but fooles and mad men till we have learned Chriſt. And he that ſhall preferre the knowledge<note place="margin">Eſt inſania praeter Chriſtum quicquam ſcire. <hi>Calv.</hi> on Col. 2. 3.</note> of the creatures before the knowledge of Chriſt, prefers trifles before treaſures, <hi>quiſquilias theſauro praefert</hi> (as <hi>Daven.</hi> on <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3.)</p>
               <p>4. Fourthly, the greateſt excellency and honour of any man, is this, that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Jeſus Chriſt; this is more then all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, beauty, riches, learning, noble birth, or whatſoever other accoutrements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord; let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdome, nor the ſtrong man glory in his ſtrength, nor the rich man glory in his riches, but let him that glorieth glory in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170650:51"/> this, that he underſtandeth and knoweth me. Jer</hi> 9. 23, 24 intimating, that the knowledge of God in Chriſt, is our <hi>greateſt glory.</hi> And certainly God regards a man no more then he ſeeth Chriſt in him: Chriſt (with God) is all and in all, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 11: That is, God hath no reſpect to a man for any thing elſe, either the more, or the leſſe to regard him, becauſe he is a Iew of the ſtock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or that he is a Gentile, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learned as were the Grecians, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned as were the Barbarians, or Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (<hi>Barbarorun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Tamberlaine</hi> in his wars, one having found a great pot of gold digd up (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.) he brought it to <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> who asked whether it had his fathers ſtamp? but when he ſaw it had the Roman ſtampe, he would not own it: So God will own none, but thoſe that have the ſtamp of Chriſt and his image upon them: But he will own the pooreſt and meaneſt of his ſervants, that have Chriſt ſhining in them, as his Iewels, as the apple of his eye, to whom he ſends his holy Angels to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l;</hi> and can the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of earthly things inrich you with theſe treaſures?</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, As Chriſt gives better things then the world hath, ſo more <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.</hi> Theſe earthly things are cald <hi>empty pits</hi> becauſe they are empty of content; though there may be ſome good in them, yet not the good we expect, that is, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> Becauſe nothing can give content but that that joynes God and the ſoule as friends together, for which end it was created, and without whom the ſoule can finde no content in all things elſe, but flies up and down like a Bee from one flower to another, from one comfort to another, to get more ſweetneſſe; but when once it enjoys God, it ſaith I have
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170650:56"/> enough; as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, I have enough my ſonne <hi>Joſeph</hi> is a live; and then is as quiet as a Bee in her hive, a bird in her neaſt, a Beaſt in her den, or the Dove in the Arke, becauſe <hi>God is alſufficient:</hi> A<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 1.</note> Bee flyes from one flower to another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe wants hony enough in that flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but when ſhe is put into a pot of hony, then ſhee ſeekes no farther: A thirſty man, give him a glaſſe of water, he is not ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for ſaith he, this little water is not able to quench my great thirſt; but cary him to a river, and then he ſaith he hath enougth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt gives more durable riches then the world hath; Al other things have their time to leave us; <hi>Hic acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runtur, hic amittuntur.</hi> Here they are gotten and here they are loſt: The world is like the gardens in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> where men may eat of the fruits of the garden what they pleaſe, while they are in the Garden, but can cary nothing out, for then the Gardner ſearcheth and emptyeth their pockets; even ſo when death comes ſhe will empty our pockets, that we can carry nothing with us out of the world. Our time is a comming that we muſt bid a ſad farewell to all things here; farewell husband, I ſhall never ſee thy face more;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170650:57"/> farewell wife, farewell children, friends,<note place="margin">Riches have wings; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are like a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall glaſſe, <hi>Quo magis ſplendeſcit citius fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur;</hi> And pleaſures like bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of ſope, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to ſee to, but quickly blown out. Luk, 10. <hi>ult</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>ult</hi>
                  </note> riches, honours and pleaſures both ſinfull and lawfull; And perhaps if we be not the better provided, we ſhall bid farwell God, farwell Chriſt, the joyes of heaven and eternall happineſſe; But Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth ever; If we know Chriſt ours, we ſhall never bid farwell to Ieſus Chriſt; He is the good part that ſhall be never ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from us; Then we may ſay as <hi>Dives</hi> ſpake (though brutiſhly) <hi>Soule take thine eaſe and be merry, for thou haſt goods laid up for many yeares;</hi> yea even to all eternity. <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na erit exaltatio, que bono latatur aeterno;</hi> That joy laſts for ever, whoſe object remaines for ever.</p>
               <p>4. But fourthly and laſtly, Chriſt brings with him the bleſſings of this world alſo, <hi>Matth. 6. 33. All theſe ſhall be caſt upon you,</hi> into the bargaine, as a loafe to the dozen or a little handfull to the meaſure. <hi>All things are yours,</hi> if you be Chriſts, for Chriſt comes not <hi>vacuis manibus,</hi> empty<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 26</note> handed. And this appeares in foure par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, we ſhall have certainty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion. We may ſay with <hi>David;</hi> the <hi>Lord is my Shepheard, I ſhall not want;</hi> for God hath ſaid it, <hi>I will never leave thee nor for ſake thee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 23. 1.</note> Heb. 13. 5. Hath he given us Chriſt, <hi>and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170650:57"/> will be not with him give us all things elſe?</hi> Rom. 8. 32. What can God deny us that is good for us, that hath not denyed to give his ſon for us? Will a man give us the Garden and not the flowers? The Land, and not the trees? and will God give us heaven and deny us earth? Are not two Sparrowes ſold for a farthing, and yet your father provideth for them? Wil God take care for Sparrowes, and young Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, &amp;c, and not for thee, O thou of little Faith? Will a man take care to feed his cattle in the field, horſe in the Stable, Swine in the Sty, and not for his wife and children that ſit at his own Table?</p>
               <p>We are ready to ſay, eſpecially the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſort, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſaid to <hi>Abraham;</hi> Here is wood, but where is the Sacrifice? Here are mouths, but where is the meat? But let us anſwer our ſoules as <hi>Abraham</hi> did his ſon; O my ſon God wil provide.</p>
               <p>Or perhaps we will ſay as the Diſciples ſaid to Chriſt; Here are a few loafes and two little fiſhes, but alas what is that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many? And yet you know with the bleſſing of Chriſt it ſerved them all The Prodigal could ſay, if once I could get home into my fathers houſe, there is bread enough.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Hagar</hi> looked into her bottle.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170650:58"/> and ſaw that empty, ſhe fell a weeping; but when ſhee ſaw the fountaine or well of water, then ſhee was ſatisfyed, for then ſhe knew ſhe could fill her bottle againe; So regard not ſo much though thy bottle be empty, remember the Well is ful. <hi>I have been young</hi> ſaith Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>and now am old,</hi> yet I <hi>never ſaw the righteous forſaken, nor their ſeed</hi> though <hi>begging their bread</hi> (as <hi>Broughton</hi> reads it) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 15.</p>
               <p>Though perhaps we may want what we deſire, yet we ſhal never want what God ſees beſt and fitteſt for us to do him ſervice withal.</p>
               <p>Alwayes, the greateſt eſtate is not fitteſt for us; as a great ſhooe fits not a little foot, nor a great ſaile a little ſhip, nor a great ring a little finger, which though it have more Gold in it, yet a leſſer were better and fitter for us. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm hath an excellent expreſſion; ſupopſe ſaith he, a King having many children of ſeverall ages, ſhould apparel them in cloth of gold: Now he that is 16 yeers old hath more gold in his robe then the child that is but five or ſix yeere old; yet the child would rather have his own garment then his elder brothers, becauſe ſaith he it is fitter for me: So if thou haſt that eſtate that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170650:58"/> is fitteſt for thee, ſurely that is beſt for thee.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, As we ſhall have certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Proviſion, ſo we ſhall have it with better right; as comming to us not onely by providence, but from the Covenant of Grace, and ſtreaming to us through the bloud of Chriſt: Wicked men have a pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntiall right as Creatures, as appeares <hi>Acts 5. 4. Was it not thine own while it was with thee?</hi> But the Saints receive them as the Spouſe, and members of Chriſt who is heyre of all. Now a man were better have courſer fare, weare meaner cloathes, &amp;c. when they are paid for, then richer, and be in the books, and his cloathes not paid for.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, we ſhall have our bleſſings<note place="margin">Deut. 28.</note> bleſſed and ſweetned with our Fathers love; which doubles their ſweetnes, like as ſweet water ſprinkled upon ſweet flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers makes every flower ſmel the ſweeter, or as wine ſweetned with ſugar makes it more pleaſant: Whereas all out of Chriſt have them with our fathers curſe, <hi>Mal. 2. I will curſe their bleſſings, yea I have cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them already.</hi> So Rom, 11. 9. <hi>Let their table be their ſnare, a trap and a ſtumbling block,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo they become like ſweet flowers poyſoned, the ſweeter the more dangerous: Hence wicked men out of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170650:59"/> Chriſt, may injoy all good, and yet injoy no good at all; Nay the more they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in bleſſings, the more their curſes abound.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a Father ſhould give a ſmall portion to his child, but withal ſaith; Son, take this portion, its but little, but thou haſt it with my love, and I pray God bleſſe it to thee; And to another he gives a greater portion, (or perhaps he puls it from him, as the Prodigall did from his father) but withall ſaith; Take it and choak with it, let it be accurſed to thee. Now there is great difference between a gift re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with our fathers bleſſing, and with his Curſe. God give me a little with my fathers bleſſing, rather then a great deale with my fathers Curſe; <hi>better is a little with the feare of the Lord, then greatrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and trouble therewith,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 15. 16.</p>
               <p>4. Fourthly and laſtly; Theſe are given in hand as pledges of our future hopes; Take theſe for preſent, but greater things are laid up for thee hereafter; <hi>Pſal. 31. 19 How great are the things thou haſt laid up for them that fear thee?</hi> He that knowes Chriſt to be his, may ſay I have theſe and heaven too, I have theſe and Chriſt too, theſe are not my portion, that is to come.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:170650:59"/>
               <p>But theſe are the wicked mans portion, <hi>Pſal. 17. 14. They have their portion in this life,</hi> there is all, they muſt expect no more; they may ſay, I have houſe and land, riches, honours, and pleaſures; but I have no part in Chriſt or Heaven: with <hi>Dives,</hi> I am merry now, but to night I may be in hell with him. Now what joy hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned man in the ſociety of all his friends, in daintieſt fare, in all delights and pleaſures, whiles he wanteth his pardon, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very houre expecting execution?</p>

               <p>3. NOw followeth the third and laſt reaſon why we ought to ſtudy to know Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the moſt comfortable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the world; In other things, <hi>He that increaſeth knowledge, increaſeth ſorrow.</hi> But the more a man knowes of Chriſt, and his part in him, the greater is his joy; A poor godly man that knowes Chriſt is his, hath more joy in his heart, and lives a more
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170650:60"/> comfortable life, then the greateſt rich man that hath all abundance, great man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, is rich in gold and ſilver, but knows not that he hath any part or portion in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 8. After you beleeved, you</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 4. 7. Pſal. 66. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>rejoyced with joy unſpeakable and glorious;</hi> yea ſuch a man carries heaven about him, and the joyes of it; <hi>for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven is righteouſneſſe, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt. Rom.</hi> 14. 17. and this appeares eſpecially in foure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
               <p>1. In time of ſpirituall diſtreſſe, when our ſinnes are gone over our heads, like mountaines &amp; milſtones, too heavy for us to bear. Come to me ſaith Chriſt, though thy heart be never ſo heavy, <hi>and</hi> I <hi>will eaſe</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 11. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>thee,</hi> when all other things will be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and miſerable comforters to thee. <hi>A ſword ſhall pierce through thy ſoule</hi> (ſaith <hi>Simeon</hi> to <hi>Mary) that the thoughts of many hearts may be opened,</hi> that is, may be <hi>eaſed;</hi> as a ſore when it is opened it is <hi>eaſed.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 1. 35</note> When I was ſcorched with the heat of Gods anger, <hi>I ſate under thy ſhadow</hi> (ſaith the ſpouſe, Cant. 2. 3.) <hi>with great delight;</hi> Like as <hi>Ionas Gourd,</hi> or a tree with broad leaves, ſhadowes from the heat of the ſunne, ſo doth Chriſt from the heat of Gods hotteſt diſpleaſure when he ſeemeth moſt angry with us.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:170650:60"/>
               <p>2. The knowledge of Chriſt is moſt comfortable in time of greateſt perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, impriſonment, baniſhment. &amp;c. (like as the Unicornes horns ſweetens all poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed waters) for <hi>then we know he will be our God, to comfort us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in all our tribulation.</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 4.</p>
               <p>The three children we know were in the fire, but unto them it was no fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt was with them in the fire; And <hi>Daniell</hi> was in the lions denn among the lions; But to him they were no lions, but as ſo many lambes inſteed of lions, becauſe Chriſt was with him in the den of lions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were whipt indeed, but it was with Roſemary branches, becauſe<note place="margin">Nihil ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit crux in nervo, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do animus eſt in Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo.</note> they found more pleaſure then pain, more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oy then ſorrow: Yea and they were in priſon too; but it was ſweeter to them then a parlour, where at midnight they Sung pſalmes for joy, becauſe Chriſt was with them in the priſon.</p>
               <p>The holy martyrs amidſt the flames of fire clapt their hands for joy, becauſe Chriſt was with them in the fire. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks ſaid one, <hi>I tread upon pearles</hi> (when he trod upon <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ott burning coles,</hi>) And, I <hi>feele no more paine then if I lay in a bed of Doune;</hi> and yet he lay in <hi>flames of fire.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170650:61"/> as the Lord hath promiſed, he<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 13. Ier. 30. 11. Pſal. 103. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>will lay no more upon us then he will enable us to beare</hi> 1. Cor. 10. 13.</p>
               <p>3. The ſaving knowledge of Chriſt is moſt comfortable in our greateſt affliction, ſickneſſes, loſſes, croſſes, diſgraces; for lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as our afflictions abound, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts abound much more, as the ſtars ſhine brighteſt in the darkeſt night.</p>
               <p>This comforted the Church in her Captivity when ſhe walked in garments rouled in blood: <hi>Yet,</hi> (ſaith ſhe,) <hi>Vnto us a Child is born.</hi> Eſa. 9. 6. Alas but cold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort a man would think for her to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a Chriſt to come 6 or 700 yeeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, eſpecially in reſpect of her preſent miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Yet this was their greateſt ſtay &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; for while Chriſt came not, ſo long they were ſure they could not totally be rooted out becauſe; God had promiſed <hi>the ſcepter ſhould not depart from</hi> Iudah <hi>till</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 49. 10.</note> Shiloh (that is till Chriſt) <hi>ſhould come;</hi> (And indeed they were never totally ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined till Chriſt came) And alſo becauſe by Chriſt, all temporall puniſhments are ſweetened and made comfortable unto us. What comforted <hi>Iob</hi> amidſt all his heavy and grievious afflictions, but this? Yet <hi>I know my redeemer liveth.</hi> &amp;c. yea even this alone ſupported <hi>Habback<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuck,</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:170650:61"/> in the time of his own, and the Churches miſery, <hi>Hab. 3. 17. 18. Though the figtree ſhall not bloſſome, nor ſhall fruit be in the vines, the laboure of the Olive ſhall faile, the feild ſhall yeeld no meat, the flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there be no herd in the ſtals, yet will I rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the reaſon is, becauſe if we know Chriſt ſavingly, we are ſure of two things.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt that whatſoever befals us, it<note place="margin">Rev. 3. 19. 2 Sam. 7. 14.</note> ſhall come in his love to us; For <hi>we are chaſtened, that we might not be condemned.</hi> And is it not mercy and love to be but whipt or branded, when a man ſhould be hanged? To be but chaſtened when he ſhould be damned?</p>
               <p>And ſecondly we are ſure that it ſhall do us good <hi>Rom. 8. 28. All things ſhall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work together</hi> with God <hi>for</hi> our <hi>good</hi> though we are not ſure of proſperity; nay we know not what afflictions we may meet withall nor what cup we ſhall drink, yet we are ſure of this, that <hi>Goodneſſe and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhall follow us all the dayes of our lives.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 23. 6.</note> If we be poore, it ſhall be good poverty; If ſick, it ſhall be a good ſickneſſe; If in diſgrace and reproch, it ſhall be good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, &amp;c. <hi>Bleſſed is he whom thou chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt and teacheſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> God will turn
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170650:62"/> all our water into wine? And (like <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> riddle) <hi>Out of the eater ſhall come meate, and out of the ſtrong ſhall come ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi> even lion-like afflictions that would ſeeme to tear us in pieces, and devour us, will bring hony and ſweetneſſe to us; As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that were forty yeeres going through a wilderneſſe full of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, (when they might have gone it in 40 dayes) but God tels them the reaſon was, <hi>That he might humble them, and prove them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 8. 16</note> 
                  <hi>and doe them good in the latter end.</hi> As in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he did. So likewiſe <hi>Ioſeph</hi> tels his brethern, <hi>You intended evill againſt me, but the Lord turned it to good,</hi> Geneſ. 50. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſtion.</hi> But you will ſay <hi>what good</hi> ſhall afflictions work for us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I Anſwer, ſomtimes they ſhal work temporall good for us in this life. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had his time to be under a cloud, and was thirteen yeeres in priſon by falſe accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but God in due time remembred him, and cauſed his ſunne to break out of a cloud, as God hath promiſed. <hi>Pſal. 37. 5 6. Commit thy way to the Lord, truſt in him, and he ſhall bring it to paſſe, and he ſhall bring forth thy righteouſneſſe as the light, and thy judgement as at noon-day:</hi> Who for 13. yeeres <hi>impriſonment,</hi> raigned four ſcoure
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170650:62"/> yeeres like a King in <hi>Egipt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> you know had ſeaven yeeres baniſhment, yet it ended in a glorious raigne of 40. yeeres continuance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ruth</hi> a while like a ſervant, may gleane among the ſheaves, but ere long ſhe is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris of all thoſe fields wherin ſhe gleaned.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Iob</hi> awhile may be ſtript of his goods, Children, and all his comforts, but ere long he doth enjoy them doubled to him, even as much more of every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort as he had before. <hi>Iob</hi> 42. 12, 13.</p>
               <p>2. But however, it ſhall alwayes worke for our <hi>ſpirituall good. By the ſad</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eceleſ. 7. 3 Heb. 12. 10 Iohn 15. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>looke the heart ſhall be made better.</hi> Like thoſe in the time of the ſweating ſickneſſe that were ſmitten with Roſemary branches to keep them waking, and from ſleeping to death; though they cryed out at the ſmart of the blows againſt thoſe that ſmot them, O you kill me, you kill me; whereas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las they had beene killed with their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, if they had not been ſmitten; Or as tender mothers that give their children ſometimes bitter wormwood and Aloes, but tis to kill the wormes (or elſe they would never let their children taſt ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a potion) and likely too, it is ſweetened with ſugar.</p>
               <p>There is a foure fold ſpirituall good by
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170650:63"/> afflictions to every one that knowes <hi>Ieſus</hi> Chriſt ſavingly.</p>
               <p>1. They keepe the heart tender and humble, pliable and buxome to God (<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering my wormwood and my gall my ſoule hath them in remember ance and is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in me,</hi> Lamenta. 3. 19. 20) as they did <hi>David</hi> when <hi>Shemei</hi> curſed him, and when God chaſtiſed him with the peſtilence, <hi>It</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 24. me me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>is I have ſinned, what have thoſe ſheepe done?</hi> And <hi>Jonas</hi> after he was caſt into the ſea and reſtored, the ſecond time he could find his way to go right to <hi>Nineveh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. They keepe us from backſliding; for elſe we would loſe our graces, as too much ſunneſhine makes the corne to ſhale and loſe its fruit.</p>
               <p>3. They make us feare to ſin that have ſo ſmarted for ſin: The burnt child dreads the fire; exellent is that ſpeech of <hi>Iob; Iob<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 34. 31, 32. Surely it is meet to be ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, I have borne chaſtiſement, I will not offend any more; That which I ſee not, teach thou me, and if I have done amiſſe, I will doe no more.</hi> As a child will feare to commit that fault for which he hath well ſmarted.</p>
               <p>4. They make us grow in holineſſe, and weane us from earthly delights (as the Iſraelites bondage made them weary of <hi>Egypt</hi>) They are but Gods pruning knives,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170650:63"/> to let us bleed, and <hi>purge us that we might bring forth more fruit,</hi> John 15. 2. like as we ſee flowers ſmell ſweeteſt after a ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; Or, as the burning buſh that burned yet conſumed not, but was the brighter for the fire; Or as gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> put into fire, loſeth its droſſe, but nothing of its ſubſtance and is made the purer gold; Or as grapes under the preſſe make the ſweeter wine; Or as wheat under the flaile hath its chaff beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en off and is the purer corne: So are affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to all that are in Chriſt, and know Chriſt theirs; They make them like Roſes, which though ſweet alwayes, yet they never drop ſweet water but when the fire is under them; Or as ſpices, when beaten to pouder, then they ſmell the ſweeteſt.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, Afflictions ſhall increaſe<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 17. Mat. 5. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> our crown of glory; the deeper our die is in affliction, the better ſhall we weare our ſcarlet robes in heaven, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18. I <hi>reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſaith</hi> Paul <hi>our ſufferings in this life are not worthy our glory that ſhall be revealed.</hi> Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſt. ſaid, if one man did ſuffer all the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of all the Saints in the world, yet they are not worth one houres glory in heaven.</p>
               <p>4. Fourthly and laſtly, The knowledge of Chriſt and him cruciſied with a ſaving
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170650:64"/> applicatory knowledge is moſt comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in the hour of death: Such a one can triumph over death, ſaying, <hi>Death where is thy ſting? Hell, where is thy victory?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 56.</note> though death in it ſelf be full of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, and is the deſtruction of nature, yet if thou art in Chriſt, and knoweſt Chriſt is thine, the cup is ſweetned with good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients. For thou art ſure of two things.</p>
               <p>1. Thou art ſure to die comfortably (or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily) and not fearing, but longing for death; <hi>we know</hi> ſaith Paul <hi>when this our tabernacle is broken, we have a houſe not made</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 1, 2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>with hands eternall in the heavens; wherfore we ſigh and grone to be clothed with our houſe which is in heaven. When</hi> I <hi>walk through the the valy of the ſhadow of death (ſaith David</hi>) I <hi>will feare no evil, for thou art with me, and thy rod and ſtaff comforteth me, Pſal.</hi> 23. 4.<note place="margin">Luke 2, 29 Phil. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>And</hi> Simeon. <hi>Now letteſt thou thy ſervant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in peace, for mine e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es have ſeene thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea ſomtimes before they go into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they are rapt up into the third heaven with joy as <hi>Paul</hi> was in his rapture 2 Cor. 12. (though in another manner) Some have profeſſed they never felt ſuch joy in all their lives as at the hour of their death.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:170650:64"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paula</hi> that noble Lady, when one did read to her (<hi>Cant. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The winter is paſt, and the ſinging of Birds is come,</hi> yes, ſhe replyed, the ſinging of birds is come, and ſo ſhe went ſinging into heaven; another being as they thought in a ſwound a little before her end, they cryed give her ſome <hi>Roſa Solis;</hi> but ſhe put it back, ſaying I have <hi>Roſa Solis</hi> you know not off.</p>

                  <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaid to his friends about him when he died, I have not ſo lived that I am aſhamed to live, nor yet feare I death, becauſe I have a good Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glover</hi> from whom God did hide his face long before, yet when he was going to the ſtake, ſaid to his frind <hi>Auſten,</hi> he is come, he is come.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> Not alwayes, but ordinarily; for ſometimes God hides his face from his own at death, as a juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for their want of cloſe walking with God in the time of their proſperity, &amp;c. and beſides we know death is fearfull in its beſt lookes (called the King of feares) as is a lion, though his teeth and claws be beaten out, or as the Hauk to the Partridge, who trembles at the very fight of her ſcattered feathers, or like a ſerpents skin that is formidable though ſtuft with ſtraw.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:170650:65"/>
               <p>The vertuous Lady Jane when ſhe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her eyes with her handkerchief, and was to ly down on the block to receive the ſtroake of death, ſhe cryed out <hi>O what ſhall I do, where is it, where is it?</hi> ſhe was filled ſo full of feare, though her faith failed not; yea Chriſt himſelfe feared death with a naturall holy feare.</p>
               <p>Yet I ſay thou art ſure at the leaſt to be freed from deſpairing feare, and to be able<note place="margin">John 13. 13.</note> to ſay with <hi>Iob, Though he kill me I will truſt in him;</hi> as our bleſſed Saviour on the croſſe, ſtil called the Lord his God, when he felt no comfort from God; my <hi>God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe Chriſt hath promiſed that <hi>neither life nor death ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God in Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. And ſecondly, If thou knoweſt Chriſt to be thine, thou art ſure to dye a bleſſed death (<hi>Reve. 14. 13. Bleſſed are the dead that dye in the Lord.</hi> &amp;c.) becauſe that day and houre thou dieſt, that day thou art ſure thy ſoule ſhall be with Chriſt in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; for to all that know Chriſt ſavingly, death is but the harbenger to bring their<note place="margin">Cyprian.</note> ſoules to Chriſt. <hi>Ejus eſt timere mortem qui ad Chriſtum nolit ire.</hi> (ſaith a father) let him fear death that is loth to go to Chriſt; do not thou feare that deſireſt to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170650:65"/> and to be with Chriſt. Death to thee is but as thy fathers horſe to cary thee to thy fathers houſe; or like <hi>Ioſephs</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot ratling with its wheeles ready to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry old <hi>Iacob</hi> to his ſon <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> ſo is death ready to carry thee to thy Saviour <hi>Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alas, our miſery lies in our life (<hi>mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur dum non morimur</hi>) not in our death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therein lies all our happyneſſe; for we ſhall not die but live ſtill, onely we ſhall exchange the place of our living; inſtead of <hi>Egypt</hi> to live in <hi>Canaan,</hi> inſtead of earth to live in heaven.</p>
               <p>Now are wee afraid to live? No, life is ſweet; then feare we not to die, for that brings the ſweeteſt and moſt happy life, and will make an exchange of a life of miſery for a life of glory.</p>
               <p>Indeed to them that know not Chriſt, O how bitter is death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It muſt needes ſting them like a ſerpent; becauſe they go from all their hapineſſe to all their miſery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Death of it ſelfe is bitter; but herein lies the ſting and ſtrength of death to all out of Chriſt, in that it is entailed to eternall death; they may ſay as once <hi>Eliſha</hi> did, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 32.

Mark</hi> 16. 16. But where the Goſpel is not revealed, (as among the Heathens) there it ſeemes not a ſinne; for we are not bound to act that which God never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to <hi>Adam</hi> nor ſince.

               </p>
               <p>Some indeed think the moralized hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens that walked by the light of nature, were ſaved (as <hi>Chryſ. Clemens Alexand. Eraſmus, Caſauhon,</hi> and others) but Chriſt tels us the contrary <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12. Though in compariſon of us that have the meanes, they are ſaid to have no ſin, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 22. I grant, whether it be a ſin or no, in the Heathens not to know Chriſt, to whom he was never revealed, is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; But of this I am ſure, if their nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive infidelity be no ſin (being <hi>ignorantia privationis, or negativa</hi>) yet their poſitive fidelity is odious, in that they truſt to dumb Idols, to the ſtock of a tree, &amp;c. when as the light of nature tels them that they themſelves are better then that they truſt

               </p>
               <p>2. The Turks that acknowledge God a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet deny Chriſt a Redeemer, though they heare of Chriſt, yet deſpiſe him, reject, abuſe him and his members, and prefer their Mahomet before him: whoſe ſin is greater, becauſe their own religion is ſo abſurd, fleſhly, and filthy, and his rewards all fleſhly, fitter for ſwine then men.</p>
               <p>3. The poore ſcatter'ed Iewes, of whom and for whom Chriſt eſpecially came, to them ſtill Chriſt is a myſtery; they acknowledge <hi>Moſes</hi> law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but reject Chriſt as an impoſtor, &amp; looke for a ſaviour to come, when Chriſt is ſo plainly preached in their own law; <hi>ſearch the ſcriptures</hi> ſaith Chriſt, for <hi>they are they which teſtify of me.</hi> John 5. 39. And yet they remain as <hi>judiciarily, ſo wilfully</hi> blind and ignorant (2 Cor. 3. 14.) as a juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own imprecation when they cryed, <hi>His bloud be on us and our children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Papiſts who nouriſh ignorance, teaching it to be the mother of devotion,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170650:68"/> when as we know that ignorance is the cauſe of ſin. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 29. and puniſhment of ſin. <hi>Rom. 1. 21. Eſa.</hi> 6. 9. &amp; ſurely that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion cannot be good which hateth the light; <hi>He that doth evill hateth the light</hi> John. 3. 10. <hi>Neither is it likely that that ſhould</hi> be the mother of devotion, that is the mother of Atheiſme, idolatry and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, as appeares <hi>Act. 17. 22. Pſal. 10. 4. Gal.</hi> 4. 8. But thus they pul out the peoples eyes, as the Philiſtims did Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and then they make ſport with them.</p>
               <p>And further, though they know Chriſt to be a Saviour, yet they make him not the <hi>alone</hi> Saviour, but joyne with Chriſt their owne workes, and make themſelves at leaſt in part, their owne ſaviours: But if wee adde but one mite to Chriſts treaſure, we ſay Chriſt is not rich enough to ſave us, and ſo we make him no Saviour, <hi>Rom. 10. 3. Gal.</hi> 5. 4.</p>
               <p>5. And laſtly, it reproveth all ignorant<note place="margin">An igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant man little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from a beaſt. Pſal. 32. Ier. 4. 22. Eſa. 1. 2. Eph. 4. 17.</note> perſons among our ſelves; a man would wonder how they can make a ſhift or ſtudy to be ſo ignorant, who are even <hi>like the horſe and mule that have no underſtanding;</hi> As in the creation, <hi>Darkneſſe covered the face of the earth,</hi> ſo of their ſoules. Ask them what Chriſt is? They anſwer ſome
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170650:68"/> of them, that he is a God, ſome a man, ſome an angel, a ſpirit, &amp;c. Learned Maſter <hi>Pemble</hi> reports of a man dying, being asked what <hi>Chriſt</hi> was, he ſaid, he thought he was a towardly young youth, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But let all thus groſly ignorant conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt their ignorance is inexcuſable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Goſpell ſhines ſo clearly in their faces (<hi>The light ſhineth in the darkneſs, but the darkneſs comprehendeth it not, Joh.</hi> 1. 10.) There is a three-fold ignorance, 1. A privative ignorance, 2. A wilfull igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, 3. A negligent ignorance. Now their ignorance is not <hi>ignorantia privationis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibilis,</hi> that is, <hi>negative</hi> or <hi>invincible igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi> but firſt it is <hi>ignorantia pravae affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis</hi> (as the Schoolmen ſpeak) That is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full from corrupt affection: It is one thing <hi>neſcire,</hi> not to know, and another thing <hi>nolle ſcire,</hi> not to be willing to know; And theſe are they that ſhut <hi>their eyes leaſt they ſhould ſee with their eyes, Math. 13. 15. Depart from us,</hi> ſay they, <hi>for we deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes, Job.</hi> 21. 14. Or ſecondly, at leaſt it is <hi>ſupina ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> ſupine, careleſs, or negligent igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when men will uſe no meanes nor take any paines for knowledge; theſe are ſaid to <hi>hate knowledge, Prov.</hi> 1. 19. And this ignorance doth much aggravate their
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170650:69"/> ſin, and make it without any cloake or colour of excuſe; <hi>if I had not come among you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>you had had no ſin, but now you have no cloake for your ſin,</hi> John 15. 22. <hi>How ſhall you eſcape that neglect ſo great ſalvation? ſaith Paul</hi> Heb. 2. 3.</p>
               <p>2. An ignorant heart is an evill heart;<note place="margin">Iohn 9. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>without knowledge, the mind is not good,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 19. 2. ſurely if the head be leprous, the body cannot be ſound; If the head be giddy, the body muſt needs ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; If the eye be dark, all the body is dark. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 22.</p>
               <p>3. All their workes are evill, and workes of darkneſſe; they can yeeld no obedience to God acceptably, becauſe it is brutiſh and not rationall ſervice; for how can we ſhun evill when we know not what is evill? Or do our duty when we know not our duty? The blind eates many a fly; and who ſo bold as blind Bayard? Ignorance made them lay violent hands upon Chriſt himſelfe; but <hi>had they known him, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Fourthly, They can have no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; for how can we repent and be greived for our ſins untill we know them? and how can we cry for mercy when we ſee not our miſery? <hi>Ionas</hi> while he was
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170650:69"/> aſleepe in the ſhip, feared not the tempeſt till awakened; the child in the dark womb cryes not, till it come into the light.</p>
               <p>5. How full of feare are they that walk<note place="margin">Light is ſweet, but darkneſſe terrible.</note> in the dark? The <hi>Egyptians,</hi> when the <hi>plague of darkneſſe,</hi> was upon them, how uncomfortable was their condition? But what horrour will poſſeſſe thy darke ſoul in that hour of darkneſſe? how terrible will death be to thee? The Sun ecclipſed at the death of Chriſt, was dreadfull; but more dreadfull will it be when the face of God is ecclipſed toward thee.</p>
               <p>6. Sixthly, Such have no part in Chriſt; for as in the creation, the firſt work God made was light, ſo in the regeneration<note place="margin">Iohn 17. 3. Iohn 4. 10.</note> the firſt grace God gives is light. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtand up from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14. The Eagle tryes her young whether they be her owne, by this ſigne if they can endure to look upon the Sun, or elſe ſhe ownes them not (as they ſay) but caſts them upon the hard ſtones; And certainly thy ignorance, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, diſcovers thee to be a child of light, or a child of darkneſſe; for God hath ſworne an ignorant perſon ſhall never come into heaven; <hi>It is a people that do
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170650:70"/> erre in their hearts, and have not knowne my wayes wherefore I ſweare in my wrath, they</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 6. 6. Ioh. 7. 49.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhould never enter into my reſt.</hi> Heb. 3. 10. Neither will God ſhew them any mercy (which is uſually their excuſe) if they be ignorant, as appeares <hi>Eſa.</hi> 27. 11. They are a people of no underſtanding, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that made them will have no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on them. Nay Chriſt hath ſaid he will <hi>come in flaming fire to render vengeance to them that know not God.</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 8. Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance will end in vengeance. Neither will voluntary or negligent ignorance excuſe <hi>a tanto</hi> but aggravate thy wrath, <hi>John 3. 19. this is condemnation;</hi> that is, this makes their<note place="margin">Ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, minuit à peccato, quantum minuit à voluntario. <hi>Aq. 2. 2. Qu.</hi> 76.</note> condemnation the greater, becauſe <hi>light is come among them, but they loved dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe more then light;</hi> and therefore it is affected darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What ſhould ignorant men do to come to the knowledge of Chriſt and their own ſalvation? I anſwer, Firſt I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them to get a Catechiſme, and if they cannot get it by heart, yet let them read it over and over, againe and againe: and for poore ſervants, let this be a part of their Sabbath dayes work; I could wiſh likewiſe that Parents, Maſters, &amp; Miniſters, would what they can, ſet upon this work; Catechiſing teacheth the firſt principles
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170650:70"/> and fundamentals in religion, and maketh<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1. &amp; 5. 12.</note> grounded Chriſtians, and would preſerve them from Schiſmes, errors, and hereſyes, and every wind of doctrine with which now ſo many are blowne away for want of being wel grounded, as a ſhip without Anchor is toſſed hither &amp; thither with the winds, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 14. But a ſure foundation will make a firme building, as the houſe that was built upon a rock, <hi>the raine fell, the floods came, the winds blew, but it fell not, becauſe it was founded upon a rock, Mat.</hi> 7. 24.</p>
               <p>2. let them uſe the meanes of hearing, reading, conference with other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans asking them queſtions. &amp;c. <hi>Let us</hi>

                  <hi>go (ſaid the people) to the houſe of the God of</hi> Iacob, <hi>and he will teach us his</hi> wayes. &amp;c. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 2. 3. Onely come with an humble and teachable heart; <hi>If any ſeeme to be wiſe, let</hi>

                  <hi>it be of God or no.</hi> John. 7. 17. But on the contrary, God will take away the knowledge we have, if we impriſon the truth in unrighteouſneſſe, as Maſters blow out the candle when the ſervants play with it. Rom. 1. 18. 21. 18.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:170650:71"/>
               <p>4. Be much in Prayer; for Chriſt is our Prophet, and if we ſeeke it of him, he will teach us ſo much as is neceſſary to ſalvation. <hi>I councel thee to buy of me Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalve.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, Thoſe that content themſelves with a generall and ſpeculative know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that Chriſt is the Saviour of the world, but know not that he is their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; that he died for ſinners, but know not whither he died for them yea or no, which is the higheſt degree of knowledge that moſt men have attained unto: But let theſe men ſeriouſly weigh theſe two things; Firſt, That generall knowledge of Chriſt by ſpeculation without appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is unprofitable and vaine. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That it is dangerous and hurt full.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay it is unprofitable and vain. It is true, <hi>it is life eternall to know God, and him whom he hath ſent, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> John
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170650:77"/> 17. 3. But it is not meant of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt <hi>by ſpeculation only,</hi> which the devils have, and yet it makes them neither more holy, nor more happy; for happineſſe conſiſts not <hi>in bonorum cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitione ſed fruitione,</hi> that is, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good things, but in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them. A Pearle in the eye doth not enrich a man (by meer gazing upon it) but a Pearl in the hand when we come to injoy it. And why did <hi>Paul</hi> ſay he counted all things as loſſe <hi>for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt?</hi> Phil. 3. 8. Surely he meant not for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt by bare ſpeculation only, which a man may know and be a divell in his life, but he meanes as after he expounds himſelfe, ſuch a knowledge whereby he may come to winne Chriſt; for ſo he addes, I count all things but as dung, that I may winne Chriſt, and be found in him, not having mine own righteouſneſſe, &amp;c. Alaſſe what profit and benefit got the old world by hearing and knowing there was an Arke, wherein ſome were ſaved, whiles they themſelves were drowned in the waters? And what good did it thoſe Iewes that were ſtung with fiery ſerpents in the wilderneſſe, to know there was a brazen ſerpent ſet up,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170650:77"/> whereby others were cured, but they themſelves died with the ſting of the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſerpents? What good, what benefit, or comfort is it to me, to heare there is a pardon for other malefactors but not for me, I muſt dy? Or for an hungry man to know there is bread enough, but I ſtarve for hunger? There are clothes, but I am naked? There is water enough in the ſea, but I thirſt, and have not a drop? So (belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) what doth it profit me to know there is a Saviour for others, but not for me, I ſhall be damned? What good doth a plaiſter if not applyed? It were as good<note place="margin">For as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> Rod, when it was out of his hand turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ſo doth Chriſt when not taken hold on by the hand of faith.</note> for thee there were no Saviour, if he be not thy Saviour.</p>
               <p>2. The knowledge of ſpeculation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out application is very dangerous and hurtfull for us, and that in three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, Becauſe it breeds bitterneſſe, grief, and vexation to the ſoule. Even the devils themſelves know Chriſt by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, but alas this knowledge of Chriſt makes them not rejoyce, but makes them tremble, <hi>or roar like the roaring</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>of the ſea,</hi> Iam. 2. 19. Suppoſe ten men in priſon condemned, and a pardon obtained for three or foure of them, but the reſt muſt die; this addes to their ſorrow: So
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170650:78"/> 
                  <hi>This,</hi> even <hi>This</hi> will fill the ſoul with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſorrow, that thouſands are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and ſaved by Chriſt, but they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are damned; As <hi>Spira</hi> ſaid, Chriſt is to me a grief and a torment, becauſe I rejected him, I deſpiſed him.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, the knowledg of Chriſt by ſpeculation only, without application m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt needs be dangerous; Becauſe if Chriſt be not thy Saviour, he will be thy judge; if thou canſt not call him <hi>Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> thou ſhalt call him <hi>Lord judge;</hi> If thou getteſt not thy part in the <hi>blood</hi> of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> thou ſhalt have thy part in the <hi>wrath</hi> of the <hi>Lamb, John 9. 39. For judgement am I come into this world,</hi> and therefore not for ſalvation to all, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his elect; Yea it is Chriſt that will give thee thy ſentence of condemnation; There is one will condemne you (ſaith Chriſt) even <hi>Moſes</hi> in whom you truſt; So there is one will condemne you, even <hi>Jeſus in whom you truſt,</hi> Iohn 5. 45. I have heard of a lawyer having a bad cauſe of a Clients to plead, yet being a good plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did keepe him off from ſentence; but the ſame lawyer being made a judge and the ſame cauſe coming before him, he that before pleaded for him, did then condemn him: So ſhall Chriſt which was your law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170650:78"/> while you lived to plead for you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come then your judge to condemne you. <hi>Then ſhall he ſay to them on his left hand, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me you curſed;</hi> Matth. 25. 31. He even <hi>he</hi> that ſhed his bloud for you, which you trod under your feet; He that wept for you, that begd reconciliation with you, but you hardened your hearts againſt all tears, expoſtulations, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrations, <hi>he ſhall ſay depart from me thou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> curſed;</hi> He that once appeared like a <hi>lamb,</hi> will then appear like a <hi>lyon,</hi> when thou wilt tremble and fear to look him in the face <hi>when all nations ſhall waile</hi>

               </p>

                  <hi>that light is come,</hi> &amp;c. in three reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is <hi>condemnation inevitable;</hi> there is
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170650:79"/> no poſſibility of ſalvation for that man, <hi>Mark. 16. 16. He that beleeveth not ſhall be damned.</hi> As <hi>Spira</hi> ſaid, God hath given me diverſe gifts, but denyed me the grace of faith, and theſe are left but to increaſe my condemnation. What hindred the Iewes from entring into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleef? And what hinders us from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but unbeleef? <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 19. God hath but two ſeats to ſit upon, his ſeat of Iuſtice and his ſeat of mercy; If Iuſtice condemn a man, yet mercy may plead for him; but if mercy condemn him there is no help for him; And God hath made but two Covenants, one of the Law, and the other of the Goſpel; If the Law condemn us, we may flie to the Goſpel, but if the Goſpel condemne us, there remains no more ſacrifice for ſin, but he muſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly periſh. <hi>He that beleeveth not ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> Iohn 3. 18. <hi>he is condemned already,</hi> wanting nothing but execution; firſt he is condemned by the ſentence of the word (<hi>he ſtands a condemned perſon</hi>) Gal. 3. 10. 2. In the Court of mercy <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 16. 3. In the Court of his owne conſcience, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 20. 4. He ſhall be as certainly damned, as if he were dam-Ned already. 5.

               <p>Secondly, It is condemnation <hi>inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, theſe judge themſelves unworthy of eternall life;</hi> As he that delpiſeth his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, tears it, or treads it under foot, is unworthy of mercy, (it is worſe then the treaſon,) theſe deſpiſe their own mercy, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2. 8. and love deſpiſed, of all other injuries, is hardlieſt borne of by God or man; how can thoſe expect God ſhould have mercy on them, that would have no mercy on themſelvs? ſurely they ſhal have judgement without mercy that would ſhew to themſelves no mercy.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170650:80"/> they might have pleaded ſome thing more for themſelves, but now their mouths are ſtopped, and are without any ſhadow of excuſe. Thirdly, this is condemnation<note place="margin">Indeed <hi>Zanch. de Nat.

Hence the Lord charged his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that if any to whom he was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red did reject him, they ſhould wipe off the duſt of their feet againſt them, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 41.</p>
               <p>The Iews rebellion, idolatry, and other ſins, were ſometimes plagued of God, by Ammonites, Philiſtines, Edomites, and others, and they were carried captive 70 years, but when once they rejected Chriſt.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170650:80"/> wiſhing his bloud upon them and upon their children, then they were rejected of God totally, and ſo have continued ſixteen hundred years together. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 24. God threatens <hi>it ſhall be eaſier for Sodom in the day of judgement, then for thoſe that refuſe Chriſt;</hi> you know <hi>Sodoms</hi> ſin and judgement, that fire came down from heaven and burnt them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, and now they ſuffer the vengeance of eternall fire; But it ſeemes the reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Chriſt is a greater ſin then Sodomy in Gods account, and ſhall have greater torments. Turks and Pagans that never heard of Chriſt, ſhall ſport in hell, in compariſon of theſe. The Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not guilty of this ſinne, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing mercy offered, and the blood of a Saviour, and therefore <hi>in this reſpect mans ſin</hi> may bee ſaid to exceed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay who rejects Chriſt, or deſires not to have his part in him?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, It is true; none abſolutely refuſe Chriſt, but upon the hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions (as they conceive) upon which he is offered, the plucking out their right eyes, parting with their deareſt luſts; As <hi>Adam</hi> preferred the forbidden fruit
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170650:81"/> before Paradiſe, as <hi>Eſau</hi> preferred his pottage before his birth-right, or as a dung hill cock prefers a barley-corn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Iewel; And thus they are truly ſaid to deſpiſe and reject Chriſt, as the yong man in the Goſpel did, that preferd the world before his Saviour, <hi>Pſal. 81. 11. Iſrael would none of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Secondly, It reproves thoſe that know Chriſt by ſpeculation, but not with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; they <hi>know</hi> him, but they do not <hi>love</hi> him; he dwelleth in their <hi>heads,</hi> but<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 17.</note> not in their <hi>hearts, rooted and grounded in love. Now ſuch as love not Chriſt, know not Chriſt</hi> in Gods account, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 8.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, what not love Ieſus Chriſt my ſweet Saviour? then it were pity <hi>I</hi> ſhould live; <hi>I</hi> were worſe then a beaſt, (as <hi>Hazael</hi> ſaid, what am I a dog?)</p>
               <p>Yet certainly there are many that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe they love Chriſt, that do not love<note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 42. Col. 1 21.

How can we ſay we love Chriſt, when we love not his members, his children, his picture and image?

And laſtly to name no more, How can we ſay we love Chriſt, when we do nothing but wilfully and witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrong him and provoke him to anger by our evill works? <hi>Deut. 31. 29. If you love me, keep my Commandements</hi> ſaith our Saviour <hi>John</hi> 14. 15. Would we ſay that man loveth us, that delights to vex and grieve us? that cares not how he wrongs us in our goods and name? &amp;c. Doth that woman love her husband that doth wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly proſtitute her ſelfe to an adulterer? or doth that child love his father that would ſhoot an arrow at his heart? Or would we ſay that man loveth us, that careleſly or wilfully omitteth any thing, he knowes we take pleaſure and good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in?</p>
               <p>In a word, he that loveth his ſins, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he that loveth him not, hath no part in him, nor doth he know Ieſus Chriſt and him crucified, but only by ſpeculation, <hi>for to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve he is precious,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 7.

               <p>1.

Surely God have given us more gifts then one; True, but as one ſun is more worth then all the ſtarres, ſo that gift excels them all; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Proverbe, we bleſſe not God for the ſtarres, when the ſun ſhines, for when the ſunne ſhines, the ſtarres ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear not.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, becauſe he is the <hi>choyceſt gift</hi> that God hath; Other gifts he gives
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170650:85"/> Promiſcuouſly to good and bad, ſo as no man knoweth love or hatred, by any thing that is before him, <hi>Eccleſ. 9. 1. Judas</hi> had the bag, and <hi>Dives</hi> fared delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly every day, when <hi>Lazarus</hi> would have been glad of his crumbes: But God never gives this gift to any, but whom he loves with his deareſt, ſpeciall, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall love. Suppoſe a Prince ſhould woe ſome great Lady, and had a Jewel worth a million: It may be he would ſcatter pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſilver, or give ſome ſlighty tokens of favour upon the ſervants; but his rich Iewel <hi>That</hi> he gives to his ſpouſe. This Iewel is Chriſt; <hi>Abraham</hi> may give <hi>Iſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> a bottle of milk, but <hi>Iſaac</hi> had the <hi>inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herein is love, in that he hath given us his only ſonne,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Iohn) 1 Iohn</hi> 4. 9. Alas, herein is love that we are out of hell, not roaring with the damned; that we are freed from the collick and ſtone, ſtrangury, and other tormenting diſeaſes; that we have bread to eat when others have none. Ask the hungry and he will tell thee that bread is ſweet; As I read in theſe late Germane warres, of a Girle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nine years of age, that asked her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaying, good mother, let me kill you; Child, ſaid ſhe, why wouldſt thou kill me?
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170650:86"/> O ſaid ſhe, let me either kill you, or do you kill me, for I am very hungry, and they ſay mans fleſh is very ſweet. But we are nor fed with mans fleſh, we feed upon the fleſh of beaſts, and of birds of the aire, and fiſh in the ſea, and the beſt of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we never were yet brought to ſay mans fleſh is very ſweet. Herein is love, that we have water to drinke, yea the blood of the grape, when others drink wormwood and gall, nay mingle their drinke with weeping and blood. <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 19, 20. Herein is love that we are not conſumed with ſword, peſtilence and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, even in theſe ſad times, when ſo many have been utterly ruined, maimed, wounded, ſlain; that when poor Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in <hi>Ireland</hi> were ſtript ſtark na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in winter froſts, and ſo were driven before them to execution, with inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of death; yet then we had clothes to put on, our houſes to dwell in, our beds to lie on, the fire to warme us, the creatures to comfort us; and we are ſtill fed with the fineſt of the wheat, our table is richly ſpread, our cup runs over, and God daily loadeth us with his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>No, no, herein is no love (comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) though we are leſſe then the leaſt of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170650:86"/> Gods mercies, but in this that he hath given us Ieſus Chriſt, that he hath given us the Iewel. It is true; it is ſome love for a Traytor to injoy meat, drink, &amp; other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts a while; but this were love <hi>indeed,</hi> if he might have his pardon; ſo this is love indeed if God give us Ieſus Chriſt: But otherwiſe we may ſay as <hi>Abraham</hi> did murmuringly, when God told him what great things he had and would give him; what doſt thou give me, ſaid he, ſo long as I go childleſſe? and truly what doth God give us (in compariſon) if he give us not the child Ieſus? But then we may ſay to God as God ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Now I know thou loveſt me, ſeeing thou haſt not denyed to give me thine only ſonne.</p>
               <p>4. Fourthly, The Lord Chriſt is the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt gift,</hi> given but to a very few, here one and there another; Iewels we know are not common but rarely given, tho pibble ſtones are common; every body have ſomething of the world, but few have part in Chriſt, yea very few, <hi>Matth. 7. 14. few find it:</hi> In all ages, God hath given this Iewel to very few: there is but twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty righteous families mentioned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was above 2000. years; in the old world but eight
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170650:87"/> perſons; In <hi>Sodom</hi> and the five cities not ten righteous; and to this day the moſt part of the world are heathens, and Chriſt is not given to one of them, to whom yet God hath given the riches of both the <hi>Indies.</hi> The Turkes whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven leave to ſit in the midſt of the world, a mighty nation, yet not to one of them (ſo dying,) hath he given Ieſus Chriſt. The Iewes, from every one of them is Chriſt hidden, who all muſt periſh and are accurſed, except God extraordinarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth Chriſt to any of them. Among the Papiſts millions of millions periſh for not knowing and truſting in Ieſus Chriſt, as their only Saviour, though perhaps ſome poor and ignorant ones God may have mercy upon. And among our ſelves how many ignorant, civill, hypocritical, profane, and deluded with common gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and a forme of Godlineſſe, (wih being <hi>garniſhed,</hi> for being ſanctified) who take copper for gold, weeds for flowers, preſumption for faith? Now though God feeds them with worldly pleaſures and delights, yet none of theſe doth God beſtow Chriſt upon. <hi>Though</hi> Iſrael <hi>be as the ſand of the ſea, yet but a remnant are ſaved; was not</hi> Eſau Iacobs <hi>brother</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>yet</hi> Iacob <hi>have I

                  </gap>au, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 2, 3. There were many widdows in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet only to the widdow in <hi>Sarephta</hi> was <hi>Elias</hi> ſent, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 26. ſo there are many people in the world, nay in <hi>England,</hi> yet to a very few is Chriſt given; as there is much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon earth, but little duſt of gold. Then what cauſe haſt thou for admiration and thankfulnes? Lord why doſt thou give this Iewel to me rather then to others?</p>
               <p>5. Fifthly, the Lord Chriſt is the <hi>ſweeteſt gift</hi> of all other; for if God gives us Chriſt, then he gives all other gifts in his<note place="margin">As the tree ſweetned the bitter waters, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> 15. 25.</note> love, and they come as bleſſings ſweetned to us. What good did <hi>Heſters</hi> banquet do <hi>Haman,</hi> while the king was wrath with him, and his face was covered? Wee eſteem a ring of gold from the king more then it is worth in ſubſtance, becauſe it is a token of the Kings favour.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Chriſt is the <hi>freeſt gift</hi> of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It coſt us nothing, we ſhall pay no<note place="margin">Gratia e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuatur ſi non gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.

Nor ſhall men pay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to obtain him, but only recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170650:88"/> him. <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come buy without mony and without price.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how is Chriſt ſaid to be freely given when I muſt repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve to receive him?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, As if a beggar ſhould ſay my dole is not free, for I was fain to go for it, and receive it; and yet that is not of thy ſelfe neither; for God is faine to give thee legs to go, and a hand to receive, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to work that condition in thee which he requires of thee; <hi>By grace you are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved through faith, it is the gift of God,</hi> Eph. 2. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how is it free, when we muſt buy it? <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> anſwer, yet its free becauſe we pay nothing but our ſinnes, which are worſe then nothing; and we give them not to God, but caſt them from our ſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would hurt us.</p>
               <p>O then let us be thankfull for, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with Chriſt, though wee want all things elſe; As if a father ſhould leave a rich Iewel to his ſon and nothing elſe, no other lumber, yet he is content with that alone, becauſe it is more worth then all other lumber; wouldſt thou ſel thy pearle for all that the world injoys? wilt thou change portions with them? Who would
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170650:88"/> exchange a Pearle for a pibble? a Crown for a coronation flower? earth for heaven? Chriſt for the world? Then ſay as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, I have enough ſo long as <hi>Joſeph</hi> is alive; and as <hi>Eſau</hi> (though<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 20.</note> upon better grounds,) <hi>I have enough my brother;</hi> and let us reſolve with <hi>Jacob, if God will give us bread to eat, and clothes to put on, we will chearfully ſerve him,</hi> ſeeing he hath given us Chriſt. And not only to be content when God giveth, but when he taketh; when we receive good from the hands of God, but when we receive evill; when we abound with bleſſings, but when with croſſes; when we enjoy all, and when ſtript of all; as the ſheep is pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as well when ſhe is ſhorne, as when her fleece groweth upon her back. This leſſon though hard, yet <hi>Paul</hi> had learn'd it. <hi>I know</hi>

                  <hi>how to be abaſed, and I know how to abound; I can be full and hungry; abound and want: I have learned in whatſoever eſtate I am, therewith to be content;</hi> and the reaſon is becauſe he had learned Chriſt. Yea though thou beeſt never ſo poor, yet if thou knoweſt Chriſt to be thine, learne to be content; for it is no token of Gods diſpleaſure to be poor, but to want Ieſus Chriſt; neither to ſpeak properly, can he be ſaid to be a <hi>poor Saint,</hi> that hath got
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170650:89"/> ſo rich a Saviour, nor he poor that is rich in faith. Suppoſe a man were robd of all his money, and had a rich Iewel about him, which they found not; would he not go home rejoycing, that ſtill he ſaved his Iewel?

               <p>4. Again, fourthly and laſtly, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is great every way; For if we be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and know it, wee have time now to ſeek after Chriſt; If a man hath a diſeaſe upon him, and know it, he may then ſend to the Phyſician for cure in time; or a man that is out of his way, if he know it in time, he may returne into the right way again: But what an intolerable vexation will it be to a man not to ſee his diſeaſe till it be paſt cure? or not to know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be out of his way, till he be at his journeyes end? ſo for a man to think himſelfe to have part in Chriſt, When he hath not, and that he is going to heaven, when he is going to hell, and yet not to know it till he comes in hell, this is the greateſt and moſt irrecoverable miſery.</p>
               <p>And on the contrary, for a man to have part in Chriſt, and not to know it (which is poſſible in time of temptation

But if a man be in Chriſt, and certainly knowes it, he hath heaven in his heart; when a man knowes he hath his pardon, then he rejoyceth in it; when he knoweth he is right in his way, then he goes on chearfully; when he knoweth the houſe is his own, he beſtowes great coſt in building, becauſe he knowes he ſhall not loſe his labour. Yea, this only, will make us die with comfort, nay with a holy triumphing over death, as being aſſured of Chriſt and a better life; <hi>death, where is thy ſting?</hi> Naturall feare a man
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170650:96"/> may have, but this aſſurance will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it, by fixing our eyes upon the joyes of heaven by the eye of faith; as it did in <hi>Simeon, Paul, Stephen,</hi> the thief on the croſſe and others.

Others thinke it is meant, the preaching of the Goſpel, which is clearer then the Law; and the word <hi>untill,</hi> doth not intend that then we ſhould regard the Prophets no more, but that we ſhould have a clearer light by the Goſpell. Therefore if thou wouldſt be ſure Chriſt is thine, let thy faith be built upon ſome<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> promiſe in the word. For faith (or aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance Chriſt is ours) conſiſts in two things. 1. to ſee Chriſt offered to us in the promiſes <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 13. as to thoſe that are weary, hungry, mourning, &amp;c. 2. To reſt upon Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſalvation, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thoſe promiſes, <hi>Heb. 11. 13. They ſaw the promiſes and embraced them;</hi> and then our faith is grounded upon a rock immoveable, when it is built upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170650:99"/> Chriſt Jeſus himſelfe being the chief cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
               <p>3. Labour to get a right underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of thoſe promiſes which thy aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is built upon; take heed of taking common graces for ſaving, weeds for flowers, <hi>Samuel</hi> for the divell in his like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Thou ſayeſt if I repent, if I beleeve, love the Saints, have good deſires, then the word ſaith that Chriſt is mine: but thou muſt know there is a kinde of faith, which a man may have, and yet have<note place="margin">Acts 8. 13. John 2. 23.</note> no part in Chriſt; as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, and the ſtony ground beleeved, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 13. So likewiſe <hi>Judas</hi> repented, <hi>Matth. 27. 3. Balaam</hi> had good deſires, <hi>Numb. 23. 10. Herod</hi> loved <hi>John-Baptiſt; Darius</hi> loved <hi>Daniel; Pharaoh</hi> loved <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> &amp;c. There are tranſient motions that are not habituall diſpoſitions; there is difference between a mark with chalk, and a fire mark, one is quickly rubd out, the other is durable: So there are light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er operations of the ſpirit which may ſoon vaniſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how ſhall I know that I rightly underſtand the promiſes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Be not willing to be deluded; compare one Scripture with another; inquire of the Miniſters which
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170650:99"/> are appointed of God thy teachers, and pray earneſtly to God to enlighten thee in the truth; and he will lead thee into all truth neceſſary to ſalvation, as it is written, <hi>Ioh. 16. 13. When the ſpirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Having got a promiſe rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, hang and reſt upon it, and be not beaten off; ſay, God hath ſaid if I mourn for my ſinnes, hunger after right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſſe, love the people of God, &amp;c. then I have part in Chriſt. But I mourne for my ſinnes, hunger after righteouſneſſe, love the people of God, &amp;c. Therefore I have part in Chriſt, and I wil truſt to his word; <hi>if I periſh I periſh;</hi> ſo did <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4. 21. and <hi>Iacob,</hi> Gen. 32. 9. 10. <hi>Thou haſt ſaid,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Return into thy countrey and I will do thee good; David</hi> alſo ſtuck cloſe to the word; <hi>Remember thy word unto thy ſervant, upon which thou haſt cauſed me to hope;</hi> Pſal. 119. 49. And the Prophet <hi>Eſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eſ. 66. 11. They ſhall ſuck and be ſatisfied with the breaſts of conſolation:</hi> ſo let us ſuck the bloud of the promiſes, as a dog that hath got the blood of the Bear, he hangs on, and will hardly be beaten off.</p>
               <p>5. Though it is true, that any one ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170650:100"/> grace whatever, is a ſigne Chriſt is thine, yea though thou haſt a 1000. temptations and doubts that thou canſt not anſwer; Yet it is good to gather an abbreviate of ſome few ſignes, that thy ſoule may feed upon in time of trouble. Theſe I acknowledge are ſo plainly laid<note place="margin">The more experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Reader that finds leſſe need of them, may be pleaſed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to paſſe them over.</note> down in Scripture, and ſo familiarly taught almoſt in every book that treats of faith, that it would ſeem almoſt loſt labour: therefore I will be the briefer, yet I dare not altogether neglect them for the benefit of ſome weak ones. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſign is, <hi>If any be in Chriſt, he is a new creature;</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. Col. 3. 9. 10. (which is called regeneration) wherby the law <hi>is written in his heart;</hi> God having<note place="margin">Though the ſtrings bee the ſame, yet the tune is changed</note> planted in him a love and liking to every good, and a hatred to all that is evill. <hi>Thou loveſt righteouſneſſe and hateſt wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> Pſal. 45. 7. <hi>A new heart will I give you; and a new ſpirit will I put within you; and I will cauſe you to walk in my ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi> Ezek. 36, 26. 27.</p>
               <p>More particularly I ſhall lay down ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven markes or ſignes, whereby a man may know that Chriſt is his in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, (which is nothing elſe but a ſtrong act of juſtifying faith)</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Signe. </seg>3</label> 3. The third ſign, <hi>from the right opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of this ſtrong faith or aſſurance that Chriſt is thine, which are foure.</p>
               <p>1. It is little at the firſt, like a little child that cannot go alone nor ſpeak, but is carried in the armes of others, and lives almoſt by nothing but ſucking and crying; ſo this weak beleever is fain to be carried in the armes of ſtronger Chriſtians, and doth nothing almoſt but cry for his ſinnes, and hunger after the word, and run to it; it is a weeping faith, full of doubtings, temptations and fears, as the poor man cryed weeping; <hi>Lord, I beleeve, help my unbeliefe;</hi> it is like<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 20</note> the <hi>ſmoaking flax and bruiſed reed,</hi> that ſmoakes with deſires, but the fire is not ſtrong enough to flame with comforts; and <hi>a reed;</hi> now a reed is a weak thing, ſcarce ſtrong enough for a bird to ſit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but much weaker if it be bruiſed; laſtly it is like a <hi>grain of muſtardſeed,</hi> which is ſo ſmall a ſeed as you can ſcarce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it; ſo is faith ſo weak at firſt, that the poor beleever can ſcarce diſcern whether he hath faith or no. But if the child bee of a mans ſtature ſo ſoon as it is born,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170650:103"/> it is a monſter; ſo if thou beeſt all of a ſuddain fully aſſured that Chriſt is thine, and no ſooner art ſtept out of thy naturall ſinfull condition, but preſently thou art ſo ſure as that thou canſt not be more; this faith is a monſter; ſoon ripe and ſoon rotten, like <hi>Jonas</hi> goard that did grow in a night, and did periſh in a night.</p>
               <p>2. It increaſeth daily, as a child grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth daily; it lies not in the heart like a ſtone in the earth, but like a tree or ſeed in the earth which groweth, ſo <hi>Rom. 1. 18. the righteouſneſſe of God is revealed from faith to faith,</hi> that is from one degree of faith to another: as the little grain of muſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, in time growes to a great tree, ſo that it is a ſhadow for the foules of the heaven; ſo the faith that before could ſcarcely be diſcerned, is now ſo ſtrong, that it is able to ſhelter other ſcorched ſoules under its ſhadow; and the babe<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 1.</note> now can go alone, yea is able to carry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther children in his armes; ſo <hi>Nicodemus</hi> that at firſt came by night, but after went openly and boldly with <hi>Joſeph</hi> to <hi>Pilate</hi> to beg the body of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>3. The third operation of faith in the heart, is, that it oppoſeth infidelity and fights againſt it; <hi>I have fought the good fight of faith,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) 2 Tim. 4. 7. and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170650:103"/> this made the poor man cry out againſt his unbelief, <hi>Mark 9. 24. Lord, help my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleef.</hi> But if there be no oppoſition in thy heart, no ſtriving againſt doubting, &amp;c. there may be bold and ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, but no faith, no certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or aſſurance that Chriſt is thine; for Satan tempted the faith of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 2. and of <hi>Peter, Luk.</hi> 22. 31. and ſurely he would ſhake thine if it were of God; but thou mayeſt feare the ſtrong man keeps the houſe, and therefore all is at peace: That man never beleeved that never doubted; <hi>the liquor of faith is never pure in theſe veſſels of clay, without the lees of diſtruſt,</hi> ſaith biſhop <hi>Hall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth operation of faith, is, if the ſame faith that makes thee believe that Chriſt is thine, doth enable thee alſo to beleeve all other promiſes for temporall bleſſings and deliverances; As <hi>Jacob</hi> beleeved God for his going ſafely back into <hi>Canaan,</hi> upon the promiſe of God for it, <hi>Gen. 32. 9. 10. I am leſſe then the leaſt of all thy mercies, &amp;c. But thou haſt ſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into thy countrey, and I will do thee good;</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved God for a child, after he had a promiſe, as well as he did for ſalvation. But many there are whoſe faith is ſtrong enough to aſſure
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170650:104"/> them of their ſalvation by Ieſus Chriſt, who yet cannot truſt God for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of temporall promiſes.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Signe. </seg>4</label> 4. The fourth ſigne is <hi>Repentance; (a</hi>) if we carry our ſinnes as Chriſt did, with a heavy and broken heart, grieving and<note place="margin">Acts 3. 19. Acts 26. 18. 20. 2 Cor. 7. 10 Zach. 12. 10.</note> mourning, for the impieties and impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our natures ſtill remaining, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the holineſſe of the ſpirit of grace, as fire to water, as light to darkeneſſe; hence <hi>Paul</hi> cryed out, <hi>O wretched man! who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> Rom. 7. 24. <hi>the evill I hate, that I do.</hi> Rom. 7. 18. Yea all the promiſes are made to a mourning ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit under ſin, Matth. 5. <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn,</hi> Pſal. 51. 17. Eſa. 61. 2. if a wound bleeds, there is leſſe danger, but it wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles if it bleeds not.</p>
               <p>Yet not every repentance (or ſorrow for ſin) is a ſign that Chriſt is ours; for <hi>Eſau, Cain, Saul, Ahab</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> had a kind of ſorrow for their ſins, in relation to the puniſhment, and as it wounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which alſo was found in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and is found even among the damned; There is water in their eyes, becauſe of the fire in their bones; every ſtubborne child will cry when the rod is on, but it is more uſually for the ſmart then for the fault; a thief grieves when he is taken,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170650:104"/> not becauſe of his theft, but becauſe he fears he ſhall be hanged. A man repents that he hath eaten ſweet meats, not but that he loved them well, but becauſe they made him ſick; children buſie about the fire, if they burn their fingers, then they will cry, but not for ſoyling their clothes, &amp;c. So to be grieved for our ſins, and love them, is but as if a ſnake ſhould caſt her coat, but keep her poiſon, or a man leave his whore, but ſtill love her, or a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant that caſts away his wares into the ſea, but tis in a ſtorme, ſtill he loves them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wicked men may weep ſalt water, tears of bitterneſſe, they cry for anger, as <hi>Saul</hi> cryed for madneſſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 16. but the Saints weep ſweet water, ſpring or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving water, even tears of love. Hence it is that when they had been <hi>pricked thus in their hearts,</hi> Peter bids them ſtill <hi>repent, Acts</hi> 2. 38. which is nothing elſe but ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (2 <hi>Cor. 7. 9.) towards God,</hi> when it proceeds from love to God, and hatred of ſin as offenſive to God, as a child grieves becauſe he hath offended a loving father. In <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. it is ſaid, <hi>they ſhall ſee him whom they have pierced, and mourne for him;</hi> that is, becauſe they have offended <hi>him.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>David Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned,</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:170650:105"/> Though no queſtion he was grieved that he had ſinned againſt <hi>Bath-ſheha</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab,</hi> yet ſpecially and chiefly becauſe he had ſinned againſt God. So <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 39. 9. <hi>how ſhall I do this wickedneſſe, and ſo ſin againſt God?</hi> So <hi>Peter went out and wept bitterly;</hi> but it was when Chriſt<note place="margin">Luke 22. 65.</note> looked upon him with an <hi>eye ſparkling full of love,</hi> as if his eye had ſaid, what doſt thou not know me <hi>Peter?</hi> am not I worth the owning, &amp;c. Some report this ſin ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected him, that every night the cock crew, he fell on his face and wept for his ſin and prayed, (<hi>Lyra, Clem. alex.</hi>) So <hi>Mary</hi> in the Phariſees houſe, when there was a feaſt, and they ſate merry at the table with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and joy, ſhe got under table, and turned her eyes (once beams of ſinfull<note place="margin">Ille verè dolet qui ſine teſte dolet.</note> luſts and pleaſures) into rivers of tears and mourning, wherewith ſhe waſht the feet of Chriſt; and her hair, her orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and net to catch wanton lovers withall, is now become a towel to wipe the feet of Chriſt withall, (<hi>yea ſome report that ſhe lived 30. years a penitent in</hi> France.) And the reaſon why ſhe wept ſo much, you ſee it was becauſe ſhe loved ſo much, it was her love to Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thoſe <hi>lovely tears.</hi> So the Prodigall lamented that he had offended his loving father;
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170650:105"/> ſaying; <hi>father, I have ſinned againſt heaven and before thee,</hi> &amp;c. and that grieves me moſt that I have offended thee.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſon why this is a certain ſign of our part in Chriſt, is, becauſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and the naturall unregenerate part cannot hate ſin, but grace and the ſpirit of God which is contrary to it; <hi>The fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> luſteth againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> we bear no love to God, we love not the thoughts of him, nor look we upon him as loving us; or if we do love him, it is only mercenarious and meretricious love,<note place="margin">Vtimur deo ut fruamur mundo.</note> as a woman that loves her husband not for his perſon, but for his riches; ſo we love God only for his benefits, naturally; not but that it is lawfull to love God for his benefits, as <hi>Mary</hi> loved much, becauſe much was forgiven her, but not chiefly and only for his benefits, but alſo for the excellency of his nature.</p>
               <p>2. If we love Chriſt with a conjugal love, with the love of a ſpouſe, even as our beſt beloved, <hi>loving nothing in heaven or earth in compariſon of him;</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 73. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>To you that believe be is precious,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 7. as he was to <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3. 8. <hi>I count all as loſſe and dung in compariſon of Chriſt;</hi> ſo <hi>Moſes, I eſteem the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke of Chriſt greater riches, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 11. 25.</p>
               <p>3. If we love the Saints and members of Chriſt <note n="d" place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 14.</note>. This mark ſtayes by us when many others cannot be diſcerned, &amp; is moſt certain; for we cannot love grace in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans heart, except there were grace in our own hearts, <hi>Gen. 3. 15. 2 Cor.</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:170650:107"/> 6. 14. Only it hath theſe qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt it is a ſpirituall love, to love <note n="e" place="margin">Col. 1. 8.</note> them in the name of righteous men, for the image of Chriſt appearing in them, and in no other by-reſpects. <hi>Epaphras hath declared to us your love in the Spirit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul; and he that receiveth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet,</hi> and a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, ſhall have the reward of a righteous man, ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 41. Now love of goodneſſe muſt needs proceed from a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, It is an univerſall love <hi>to all the Saints,</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Col, 1. 4.</note> there being the ſame reaſon of loving one as another, even the ſpirit of Chriſt that dwelleth in them, which is the ſame in all, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3. And hence it is that they love them, though they be poore Saints. 2. Though afflicted Saints. 3. Though hated and deſpiſed of others. 4. Though they have many infirmities. 5.

               <p>3. Thirdly, In reſpect of the degree, it is a ſpeciall and choice love, they love them as brethren and ſiſters, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. ult.

               </p>
               <p>2. Secondly, In a readineſſe to help them if they be in need, and do them good before others; they will do good to all, (becauſe <hi>miſericordia non quaerit de meritis ſed de miſeriis,</hi> mercy looks not at worth but at miſery) <hi>but eſpecially to the houſhold of faith,</hi> Gal. 6. 10</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly in delighting in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, more then in the ſociety of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men; <hi>I am a companion of them that feare thee,</hi> ſaith <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 101 6. Pſal. 6 8.</note>

                  <hi>himſelfe with the diſciples,</hi> Acts 9. 26. Oh how the hearts of <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were knit together, and how they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in the ſociety each of other?

                  </note> together in their kind; ſheep and hogs go not together, nor do doves and crows fly together. Many times a man walkes
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170650:109"/> ſo cloſely and covertly, that we cannot diſcern what he is by himſelf, yet a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to one but he may be known by his companion he is moſt delighted withall. The Lacedemonians marked what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany their children kept, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judged of their diſpoſitions. And <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt Caeſar</hi> marked at a combate what company courted his two daughters; and when he eſpyed grave Senators talke with <hi>Livia,</hi> but young and wanton per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with <hi>Julia,</hi> &amp;c. he conceived accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly of their diſpoſitions, that one would prove a wanton, the other would be the more ſober. Why ſeek you the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving among the dead? <hi>ſaith our Saviour;</hi> Never but one (that was living) deſired to keep company with the dead, and he was poſſeſſed with a legion of divels. A man out of Chriſt cannot poſſibly make a godly man his choice ſociety, in whom he takes moſt delight; for what communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath light with darkeneſſe? and what fellowſhip hath righteouſneſſe with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe? and what concord hath<note place="margin">Amos 3 3.</note> Chriſt with <hi>Belial?</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 6. 14. we know God hath put enmity between the<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> ſeed of the woman and the ſeed of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. An Iſraelite is an abomination to an Egyptian. Indeed a godly man conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth

(And its Gods will, both tares and wheat ſhould grow together till the harveſt, as clouds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſtarres, weeds among the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, thornes among the Lilies.) But the Saints are his choice ſociety, in whom he<note place="margin">Cant. 6 9.

               <p>4.

Firſt, the heart is moved and exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">Infertur appetitus orandi Aug. ad ſimplic. <hi>l.</hi> 2.</note> by the ſpirit to be often with God in prayer, as the child naturally cryes and runs to the mother, the young to the dam; So that they make conſcience to performe it, and cannot live without prayer, <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 8 26. Pſal. 19. 1. 64. Seven times a day will I praiſe thee, &amp;c.</note> eſpecially not without pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer.

Behold he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> And <hi>Cornel.</hi> Act. 10. got upon the top of the houſe, &amp; there was alone with God in prayer; <hi>Daniel</hi> three times a day pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his cloſet, when he was in danger of his life. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> reports of his ſiſter <hi>Gorgonis</hi> that her knees ſeemed to cleave to the earth by her often praying; and <hi>Gregory</hi> of his Aunt <hi>Trucilla,</hi> her elbow was as hard as a horn, by often leaning upon a desk when ſhe prayed; <hi>Euſebius</hi> reports of <hi>James,</hi> that his knees were as hard as Camels knees, bereaved of ſenſe by often praying; And one reportes of <hi>Ioachim</hi> the father of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that he would often ſay, <hi>Cibus &amp; potus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi erit oratio,</hi> Prayer is my meat and drink; whereas naturall men have no ability or gift of prayer, they cannot pray; many a wiſe man that can ſpeak eloquently, yea

Nor that we have received the <hi>ſpirit of Adoption,</hi> for that would make us <hi>cry Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>a father,</hi> Rom. 8. 15. It may be ſuch cannot pray eloquently, nor ſo as their words will well hang together, yet they can weep, ſigh and groan, which are the ſtrongeſt prayers, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 26. 27. Others there are that have no liſt to this duty, they cry what a wearineſſe is it, (<hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13) and never pray for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake, out of love to the duty, but only out of cuſtome for faſhion ſake, or in diſtreſſe, as the Mariners in the ſhip with <hi>Ionah,</hi> when they were in a ſtorme,<note place="margin">Jonah 1. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>then they cryed every man to his god,</hi> but yet he delighteth not himſelfe in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, he will not alwayes call upon God, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaks of the hypocrite, <hi>Iob.</hi> 27. 10. Now theſe and ſuch like, are ſo farre from having any faith in Chriſt,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170650:113"/> that they may rather be called Atheiſts who think there is no God, nor do they beleeve his providence; <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no God,</hi> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 14. 1. hence it followes, v. 4. <hi>He calleth not upon the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Secondly, by the ſpirit of prayer, the heart is not only excited and enabled to pray, but to pray ſpiritually, to make a ſpirituall prayer; as the Apoſtle exhorts that we pray with all manner of prayer and <hi>ſupplication in the ſpirit,</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 6. 18.</note> and to pray in <hi>the Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Jude 20.</note> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tels us the ſpirit helpeth our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; though we know not what nor how to ask, yet the ſpirit makes interceſſion for us with groanings, &amp;c. <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 8. 25, 26.</note> which aſſiſtance of the ſpirit, conſiſts not in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly invention, or compoſure of words and eloquent phraſes, for ſome godly people may want this, and it is but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gift, and the common, not the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall help of the ſpirit promiſed, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 27.</p>
               <p>But the ſpirit of prayer conſiſts in three things. Firſt in enabling us <hi>to pray in faith</hi> with a childlike ſpirit, that can go to God as a <hi>father,</hi> and not as to a <hi>ſtranger</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 8. 15. Eſa. 63. 16. Lords prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note>. Wicked men pray, but they have not the ſpirit of prayer, becauſe they
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170650:114"/> pray not in faith, but ſhoot their arrows at randome, never regarding nor looking after them. Now theſe are but <hi>bold nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratious,</hi> (or orations) <hi>not humble petitions.</hi> It is true, a man in Chriſt may have riſings of infidelity, but they are overcome by faith.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, The ſpirit of prayer, conſiſts in enabling us to pray fervently; the ſpirit helpes us ſaith the Apoſtle, to<note place="margin">(<hi>c</hi>) Rom. 8. 26.</note> pray with ſighs and gronings which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expreſſed; the affections are as it were ſet on fire by the Holy-Ghoſt. Thus <hi>Hannah</hi> poured out her ſoul before the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 15. So <hi>Hezekiah</hi> turned his face to the wall, and wept ſore, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 38. 1. and <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſtled with God in prayer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24. Wherefore cryeſt thou to me ſaith God to <hi>Moſes? Exod.</hi> 14. 15. and <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtrove with God from fifty to ten, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 23. eſpecially our Lord Chriſt, <hi>who prayed with ſtrong crying and tears.</hi> Invention may make us ſpeak, but<note place="margin">Non ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per opus eſt clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, quia deus ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria audit. Non vox ſed votum non muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, &amp;c.</note> the ſpirit will make us cry, which yet conſiſts not ſo much in ſtrength of words, as of affections; naturall men may have <hi>externall elocution,</hi> but want <hi>inward affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> they are dead and cold prayers; they uſually pray as though they cared not whether God heard them or no, like
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170650:114"/> cold Suitors that care not whether they<note place="margin">Ludit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um qui ore petit quod corde negligit.</note> ſpeed or no, they want the <hi>aſpiration</hi> of the ſpirit to pronounce <hi>Shibboleth. Caut.</hi> Not that a Chriſtian is alwayes alike in prayer, but as the ſpirit pleaſeth to help with his adjuvant cooperating grace, (without me ye can do nothing) the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit muſt <hi>inſpirare,</hi> or we cannot <hi>exſpirare, The wind muſt blow that the ſpices may flow, Cant.</hi> 4. 16. we are like a ſhip at ſea, if the wind blow it goes amain, or elſe it creeps upon the ground; ſometimes like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> chariots onr wheeles are taken off and we drive heavily, and ſometimes like <hi>Joſephs</hi> chariots we drive chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly and laſtly, to pray with the ſpirit, is to pray with ſpirituall deſires, when we pray for ſpirituall things, or for temporall bleſſings, with ſpirituall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and ſpirituall ends, to honour God by them as Chriſts petitions were, <hi>John</hi> 17. and as we are taught in the Lords prayer. A naturall man may be very earneſt in his prayer, yet it is not a ſpirituall prayer, becauſe his deſires have only reference to ſelf-love, and naturall ends, but not to God and his glory. <hi>They have not cryed unto me with their hearts, when they howled upon their beds,</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:170650:115"/> ſaith the Prophet, <note n="e" place="margin">Hoſ. 7. 14.</note> where the Prophet eſteems of their <hi>prayers</hi> no better then <hi>howlings,</hi> like the howlings of Baals Prieſts, who cryed aloud, <hi>O Baal hear us, and they cut themſelves till the blood guſhed out upon them.</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">1 King. 18. 28.</note> Therefore ſuch pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers God ſometimes ſends away with a mock, rather then an anſwer, <hi>Prov. 1. 28. 29. when diſtreſſe and anguiſh ſhall come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you; then ſhall they call upon me but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me.</hi>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170650:115"/> It was the commendation of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, They were juſt before God, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in all the commandements of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproofe,</hi> Luke 1. 6. And this <hi>Paul</hi> makes a mark of a good conſcience to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in all things to walk exactly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 18. And it muſt needs be ſo; becauſe the whole law is written in our hearts, one precept as well as another, <hi>I will put my lawes into their minds, and write them in their hearts,</hi> Heb. 8. 10. that is, I will plant an habituall diſpoſition and inclination in their hearts, to a love and liking of them; by giving them a new heart and a new ſpirit. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. and this inclination is to one precept as to another, and he that hath not a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, liking, and indeavour to keep all, hath it not to keep any, Hence ſaith <hi>Iames,</hi> Iam. 2. 20. he that <hi>keeps the whole Law, and offends in one point, is guilty of all,</hi> (that is <hi>diſpoſitivè,</hi> though not <hi>formalitèr</hi> or <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualitèr</hi>) he hath an inclination to break them all, though he doth not actually break them all, and his heart is not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right before God.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe there is the ſame reaſon why we ſhould make conſcience to abſtain from one ſin as from another, and to performe one duty as another; So ſaith the Apoſtle,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170650:116"/> 
                  <hi>For he that ſaid do not commit adultery, ſaid alſo do not kill, &amp;c.</hi> Iam. 2. 1. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps an upright man may fall into ſin, but yet he never fals from his reſolution; in my mind ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> I ſerve the law of God, though in my fleſh the Law of ſin; for though there be an inclination &amp; deſire to do the will of God, yet there is a contrary inclination of the old man againſt the will of God, the fleſh luſts againſt the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>I grant likewiſe, a man out of Chriſt may have reſolutions againſt ſome ſins, (though alwayes for the evils that come from ſin, and not that are in ſinne, for the frnit, and not for the filth of ſin) but it is not univerſall, but he hath alwayes ſome reſervation'; God be mercifull to me in this, or that; ſome luſt he cheriſheth (and ſayes as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> it ſhall not go) As <hi>Herod</hi> his <hi>Herodias, Jehu <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The weapons of our warfare, are mighty through God, to caſt down ſtrong holds and high imaginations, and bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt,</hi> as a ſervant gives up himſelfe to the will of his maſter, or wife to her husband; and the reaſon is, becauſe he receives Chriſt as a Lord and Saviour; Come to me ſaith our Lord Chriſt &amp; I wil eaſe you, &amp;c. but not except you <hi>take my yoke upon you. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a child is born, and the Government is upon his ſhoulders,</hi>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170650:117"/> ſuffer any thing thou wilt have me, I am wholly at thy diſpoſall; and with the Prodigall, receive me father, and make me not a ſon but a ſervant, <hi>yea a hired ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> (As Abigail ſaid, <hi>let me be a ſervant to waſh the feet of the ſervants of my Lord</hi>) And with <hi>David,</hi> if he ſaith he hath no pleaſure in me, let him do with me as ſeems good in his eyes. <note n="c" place="margin">2 Sam. 15. 26.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And this diſcovers many, that thinke they have part in Chriſt, (that they know<note place="margin">Eſ. 1. 2.</note> Chriſt is theirs) are deceived, becauſe their faith works not obedience, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; they beleeve him, but will not take his yoke upon them; they ſay; <hi>To them a child is born, but they pluck the Governement from his ſhoulders;</hi> living in conſtant rebellion againſt God, and only according to the law of their own minds, that is, walking after the ſtubbornneſſe of their own hearts <note n="d" place="margin">Deut. 29. 19.</note>.</p>
               <p>Perhaps they are content Chriſt ſhould rule them, ſo farre as he pleaſes them, and as his will likes them: but if it diſlikes them, Chriſt may deny himſelfe if he pleaſe, and ſtoop to their will, for they cannot, will not ſtoop to his; God be mercifull to them, in this their will they muſt have (though it croſſe Gods will) ſaying as the Jewes, we have no

                  <hi>they that mourne, for they ſhall be comforted,</hi> Matth. 5. 44. And likely either when

               <p>2. The ſpirit witneſſeth alwayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word, and that by diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the promiſes in the word to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, perſwading us that they belong to us. <note n="a" place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 14.

               </p>
               <p>3. It fils his heart with love and thankfulneſſe to God, and makes him more watchfull and carefull to walke in anſwerable obedience. <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 31. 2 Cor. 5. 14. 1 Ioh. 3. 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But on the contrary, if it makes thee bold and preſumptuous to walk in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courſes, and more remiſſe and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in thy walking with God, thou mayeſt feare it is not a teſtimony of the ſpirit, but a deluſion of the divell.</p>
               <p>4. It hath its own witneſſe, even a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret manifeſtation to the conſcience, that it is the ſpirit of God, and not a deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:170650:121"/>
               <p>There are likewiſe ſignes of a weak aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that Chriſt is ours; As earneſtly to long after Chriſt, as he is offered: They would faine beleeve and grieve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot, they mourne under their ſinne, and make conſcience of their wayes, who though they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, yet they dare not willingly ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, &amp;c. Theſe have ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of a true and ſaving knowledge of Chriſt, and are not to be diſcouraged, becauſe Chriſt hath promiſed not to quench the ſmoaking flax, nor break the<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 20.</note> bruiſed reed; and he hath pronounced them bleſſed that mourne, that are poore<note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> in Spirit, that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe. Therefore truſt firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon theſe promiſes, live and die with them, and ſay, if I can periſh with theſe markes, I am content to periſh.</p>
               <p>There are likewiſe ſigns of a ſtrong aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that Chriſt is ours. As when a man can hang upon God without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or apprehenſion of favour, nay when the Lord ſeemes to ſmite him with great afflictions. <note n="a" place="margin">Iob. 13. 15. Gen. 22. Pſal. 42. 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>2. When he is fild with raviſhing joy and peace in beleeving, more then he can expreſſe. <note n="b" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 8. Rev. 2. 17.</note>

               <p>3. When he can contemne the world

               <p>IN the next place, conſidering notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the former cleare eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our part in Chriſt, yet Chriſtians are continually aſſaulted with doubtings and feares of their condition: and no wonder, conſidering the evill heart of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170650:122"/> that ſtill remaines within them, <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 3. 12.</note> which Satan helpes forward by his tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, who <hi>deſires to winnow us as wheat, that our faith might faile us,</hi>

               <p>Firſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doubt. </seg>1</label> I feare whether Chriſt be mine, becauſe I know not the time of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, when ſome know both the time, miniſter and ſermon that wrought upon them.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, its true, firſt, ſome do know the particular time of their converſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they may be converted at one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as the three thouſand in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. though more rarely now then heretofore, becauſe in the primitive times, the Church was more quick in her delivery, then ſince.</p>
               <p>2. Others though they know not the time of their <hi>converſion,</hi> yet they know the time when they were <hi>not converted;</hi> they ſee a plaine change in them, from what once they were; they can ſay they were blinde, and now they ſee; they were dead but now alive, that they hate what
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170650:122"/> before they loved, and love what before they hated, that they are new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>3. Some there be (though very rare) that never ſaw any change in them, and yet may have part in Chriſt, ſuch as are ſanctified from the wombe, as was <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Ieremy,</hi> &amp;c. or when they were very young, which ſometimes hapneth to ſuch as have had godly education, in whom God wrought grace ſo inſenſibly, as the change was never diſcerned, though there was a time when they were without grace.</p>
               <p>But if we ſee any worke of grace in us, this ought not to trouble us; ſhall I doubt whether I am alive, (when <hi>I</hi> can breath, ſpeak and move as living men do) becauſe I know not when life was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me? or whether I be born, becauſe I know not the time when I was borne?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doubt. </seg>2</label> I feare whether I have part in Chriſt, becauſe I know not whether I were ever ſufficiently prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt. I fear I have not been humbled enough; The plough hath not gone deep enough, I wanted depth of earth; for I read, <hi>Matth. 13. 5. becauſe they had not much earth, they withered,</hi> and many have had deeper humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170650:123"/> then ever I met with, by farre.</p>
               <p>I anwer, though all are (uſually) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared or humbled to receive Chriſt: yet firſt God hath not ſet down the quantity, but the quality: he calleth thoſe that are weary and laden, ſick, broken-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtung with their ſins, &amp;c. but he ſaith not if they be thus much humbled, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken-hearted &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, As ſome women bring forth their children with more pain then other (as was before touched) ſo ſome are more humbled then others are, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in <hi>Pauls</hi> converſion, and the Iailors compared with the converſion of <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias, Lydia</hi> and others. Rough wood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires many wedges, and many blowes before ever it will ſplit, and hard mettle requires a great fire before ever it will be melted, when a ſofter mettle, a leſſe fire ſerves the turn; God knowes what is beſt and fitteſt for every man.</p>
               <p>3. Then a man hath been ſufficiently humbled or prepared, when he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive Chriſt as his Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which is the end of humiliation. As then a woman hath paines enough, when the child comes forth; then <hi>Jacob</hi> was pinched with famine enough, when he was willing to let <hi>Benjamin</hi> go; then
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170650:123"/> the child is beaten enough when his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack is broken to ſtoop and yield. That Phyſick is ſtrong enough that cures the malady; Some go to hell with more humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation then others go to heaven with; when they roar, but will not let go their luſts, as <hi>Ahab, Iudas,</hi> &amp;c. Now if thou haſt enough, though not ſo much as others, what needs more? if a little wound will ſerve the turn, what need a deeper? if a pin, what needs a ſword? art thou more cruell to thy ſelfe when God is more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull? if eaſier Phyſick will cure, what needs a more bitter potion? can you drink their cup? you know not what you ask; that that but cured them, might have been too ſtrong for thee.</p>
               <p>I doubt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doubt. </seg>3</label> becauſe I doubt: I have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny temptations that I nothing but doubt, though I know the word is true, and I cannot object againſt it. But God hath ſaid, <hi>being juſtified by faith we have peace with God,</hi> Rom. 5. 1.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, there is a twofold doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either from <hi>want of faith,</hi> which is not properly doubting, but totall infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and diſtruſt; or ſecondly from <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith,</hi> when it aſſents to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, yet is joyned with ſuſpicions and feares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now theſe may ſtand with faith,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170650:124"/> as the poor man that wept ſaying, <hi>Lord I beleeve, help my unbelief;</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Mark. 9. 24.</note> for the root of infidelity within us will oppoſe faith, <note n="b" place="margin">1 Theſ. 3. 10.

                  </gap>ow thee as wheat, &amp;c. But I have prayed that thy faith ſhall not faile thee.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, I anſwer, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we have peace with God, and ſo we have, for God is at peace with us, though we do not alwayes diſcerne it, (as the root remaines ſometimes when the flower is gathered.) But he doth not ſay we have peace with the world, with the divel, with our luſts, &amp;c. for the world will now hate us, that loved us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the divel will tempt and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault us bitterly, that ſeemed quiet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and our own ſinfull luſts will now wound, vex and trouble us, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not before, and God will oſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict us more then he did before.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doubt. </seg>4</label> I doubt becauſe I cannot act faith, my faith failes me, I cannot reſt my ſoule upon Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, we muſt diſtinguiſh between the <hi>habit</hi> and the <hi>act</hi> of faith; the habit or
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170650:124"/> grace of faith, that is, the inward principle or quality of faith, infuſed by the holy-Ghoſt, this never failes, but is an abiding quality; <hi>now abideth faith, hope, charity, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 13. But the act of faith may ceaſe for a time, and doth in the beſt ſometimes, eſpecially in time of temptation; as it was in <hi>Abraham</hi> when he ſaid of his wife, ſhe is my ſiſter; in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> who ſaid, I ſhall one day periſh by the hand of <hi>Saul;</hi> and in <hi>Peter</hi> when he denied Chriſt and forſwore him.

               <p>Fifthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doubt. </seg>5</label> I doubt becauſe I want aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance &amp; comfort; <hi>when ſome rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and glorious,</hi> they have taſted hidden Manna, and have gotten the white<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 8.</note> ſtone and the new name which no man knowes but they that have received them, and are filled with peace that paſſeth all underſtanding.</p>
               <p>1. I anſwer; firſt, comfort is not the ſtanding diſh of a Chriſtian in this life; as
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170650:125"/> we make not a meale of ſweet meats, but they are as a ſecond courſe to cloſe up the ſtomack; your conduit pipes do not runne ſweet water all the yeere, but at a Kings Coronation, or at ſome day of ſpeciall ſolemnization; we give Cordials onely when men are ſick.</p>
               <p>Our Lord Chriſt after his reſurrection appeared indeed to his Diſciples, but hee was quickly gone, it was but a ſight and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; as <hi>Latimer</hi> ſaid of the ſpirit, it is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and coming; comfort is reſerved for Heaven, and we have but a taſte on earth, to teach us to walk by faith, and not by ſight, and to teach us to expect our life of comfort in Heaven, and not on earth.</p>
               <p>2. Comfort is not of the eſſence of faith, but a degree of glory; Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wanted comfort when he cried out,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 7. Iohn 20. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>My God my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> but he wanted not faith, but he ſtill called him his Lord &amp; his God: So <hi>David,</hi> when he prayed to God to reſtore to him <hi>the joyes of his ſalvation,</hi> had no joy, nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of it he roared all day. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. So <hi>Iob, Heman</hi> and others, and yet their faith fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not.</p>
               <p>Now we are not to believe, ſo long as comfort laſts, but ſo long as the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes laſt, which are better then comfort
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170650:125"/> without them; if we have not the ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his countenance, let us be glad of the ſhining of his graces; if we have not the ſun-light of his ſpirit, let us be glad of the ſtar-light of the fruits of his ſpirit; if we have not the Holy-Ghoſt the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let us be glad of the Holy Ghoſt the humbler, ſanctifier, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He that makes joy and comfort the ground of his faith to reſt upon, reſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an inconſtant object, and will be toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up and down daily with continuall feares; let us bring our feeling down to our faith, and not our faith to our fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; he that will not beleeve God in his promiſes, would hardly beleeve, if he had comfort from him; how ſhall we prove our comfort, but by the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?</p>
               <p>3. That is the ſtrongeſt faith that can believe without comfort, yea when God frownes upon us, as <hi>Iob</hi> did, <hi>though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> Every body can ſay the ſunne ſhines, when we ſee the light and feel the heat, as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Thomas,</hi> thou wilt not believe except thou ſeeſt, but bleſſed are they that have not ſeen and yet have believed, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Pſal. 42. 11.

               <p>I anſwer, there are relapſes into enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, which are <hi>peccata vaſtantia conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam,</hi> theſe a godly heart doth ſeldome relapſe into, though ſometimes through weakneſſe of grace they may, as <hi>Peter</hi> and others.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Some affirme that groſſe ſins of beleevers are not pardoned, no not in heaven, till they do actually repent of them, that they cannot ſay, My God, and my Chriſt, &amp;c. but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do incurre an actuall guilt of eternall damnation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170650:127"/> upon the perſon (at leaſt <hi>pro tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>) ſo as if <hi>David</hi> ſhould have died before his actuall repentance, &amp;c. he ſhould have been damned.</p>
               <p>Its anſwered, the ſins of beleevers are not only actually pardoned (in heaven) after ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual repentance, but before any ſubſequent act of repentance, even at once in the firſt act of Beleeving and Repenting: So as if <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> had died, one in the act of his adultery, and the other in the act of his denyal of Chriſt, yet they had been ſaved; though (as they ſay) they cannot conceive a regenerate perſon can commit a known ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſin without ſome preſent act of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſome reſiſtance of ſpirit (cald <hi>diſpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia vel reniſus voluntatis) Cum peccant, ea tantum parte qua non ſunt regeniti peccant, ſecundum vero interiorem partem, nolunt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantur peccatum, ergo non plena voluntate peccant,</hi> Zanch. Epiſt. 91. p. 114. And to this agrees that in <hi>Gal. 5. 17. 1 John 3. 9. Rom.</hi> 7. 13. 24. But that he ſtands a condemned man till ſolemn acts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as confeſſion, petition, &amp;c. they deny.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe in the firſt act of beleeving, our ſinnes are ſo pardoned, as there is no place or time after left for condemnation; <hi>he that believeth, hath everlaſting life,</hi> John
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170650:128"/> 3. ult. and <hi>cap.</hi> 5. 23. but if at any time any one ſin were not pardoned, he were for that time under the curſe &amp; in the ſtate of condemnation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. but can a man have right to heaven and hell at the ſame time?</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe ſtill he is regenerated, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 9. the ſeed of God remaineth in him; but he that is in the ſtate of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, cannot be in a ſtate of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>3. Still hee remains a beleever, and a penitent perſon in habit at leaſt, (except by his fall he hath loſt all grace, as the Arminians hold) but a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever is ſtill a juſtified perſon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. &amp; they ſay they cannot ſee how that man can be properly ſaid to be juſtified, though he be acquitted of a thouſand offences, if he ſtands guilty of any one offence, for which at that time he is in the ſtate of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, except we will ſay a man may be in a ſtate of Juſtification, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, of life and death at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>4. In the preſent act of his ſinne, he is united to Chriſt, and a member of Chriſt; but a member of Chriſt cannot be in the ſtate of condemnation; for then at the ſame time a member of Chriſt may be a member of the Devill.</p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:170650:128"/>
               <p>5. He is ſtill an adopted child of God, notwithſtanding his fall, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. 13. but every adopted child is an heire of heaven; <hi>if ſonnes, then heirs,</hi> Rom. 8. therefore till he loſeth his ſon-ſhip he cannot loſe his right to life; it would ſeem ſtrange, that God at the ſame time ſhould be <hi>pater &amp; hoſtis, reconciliatus &amp; infenſus,</hi> a father and an enemy.</p>
               <p>6. If greater ſins are not forgiven till after actuall repentance: then neither are the leaſt and ſmalleſt ſinnes, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted every moment, forgiven, till after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall repentance; for all ſinnes deſerve condemnation, as well the leaſt as the greateſt, (though ſome deſerve a greater degree of torment, <hi>Gal. 3. 10. Rom.</hi> 6. ult.) &amp; ſecondly, there is the ſame way appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, for the pardon of the ſmalleſt ſins as of the greateſt, <hi>viz.</hi> faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but it cannot be true of the ſmalleſt ſins, becauſe then a beleever ſhould never be juſtified a minute together; for as for idle thoughts, &amp;c. we are continually acting, and ſo a beleever ſhould almoſt every minute be in the ſtate of death; and then they ſee not but in <hi>ictu mortis,</hi> he may periſh, except the laſt opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſpirit, be actuall repentance. Yea if leſſer ſinnes (<hi>peccata quotidianae
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170650:129"/> incurſionis</hi>) need daily repentance, ſurely that daily repentance is actuall repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and then even thoſe ſins are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given till actuall repentance.</p>
               <p>7. Then it is certain a beleever after his fall into ſome groſſe ſinnes, ſhall live ſo long by Gods decree, till he actually repents, (as the elect ſhall, till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve) but they conceive this hath no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from ſcripture, that a beleever ſhall not die in the act of a groſſe ſin, as adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſelfe-murther, bitter and malicious ſpeeches, when perhaps the provoked party may immediately run him through, &amp; kill him; yea this they ſay ſeems to judge too rigidly of thoſe that die by ſelfe-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as drowning, hanging, ſtabbing themſelves, &amp;c. which though it be a ſin to be trembled at, it being blood, &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea ſelf-murther againſt our ſelves, to whom we owe greateſt love, yea the laſt act is ſin, and our hope of the ſalvation of theſe is exceedingly weakned by ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and dreadful an act, yet they beleeve it were harſh judgement to conclude theſe certainly damned; but what time have theſe men for actual repentance, when they may die <hi>ipſoictu,</hi> and as the wound may be, their repentance muſt be very ſhort, having ſcarce time enough to ſay Lord have mercy upon me.</p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:170650:129"/>
               <p>8. That that inſtrumentally juſtifies on our part, is not repentance, but faith, becauſe faith only layes hold upon the merits of Chriſt, and by it the merits of Chriſt are imputed to us; and repentance only juſtifies <hi>declarative,</hi> as an evidence and fruit of faith, or as a ſpeciall conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant of it. But pardon of ſin is an act of juſtification, therefore, rather actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all faith is required, (at leaſt as well as actuall repentance) before actuall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Its anſwered, there is a twofold for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe.<note place="margin">In foro poli, &amp; in foro ſoli.</note> 1. <hi>In foro dei</hi> in the Court of God. 2. <hi>In foro conſcientiae</hi> in the Court of conſcience. Now in Gods Court, all ſins paſt, preſent, and to come, are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pardoned, at the very firſt act of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving and repenting. But ſecondly, in Court of conſcience to have apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or comfort of pardon, ſo they are not pardoned, that is, we ſhall have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or aſſurance of the pardon of them, till we actually repent of them, which is called our renewing by repentance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. as is ſeen in <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 32. and Pſal. 51. who till he confeſſed his ſin and actually repented, he roared all day, and his moiſture, &amp;c. and he had no
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170650:133"/> comfortable aſſurance that his ſin was pardoned, till then. Nor <hi>Peter</hi> till he wept bitterly. Again, a beleever prayes for pardon daily of his treſpaſſes, for two reaſons. 1. To have his faith ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his pardon, and to have more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it; for our faith at the beſt is weak and full of doubtings, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally after great fals, which blot our evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that we cannot well read it, and hide Gods countenance from us, as clouds hide the ſhining of the ſunne. 2. We contract, though not an eternall, yet a temporall guilt by actuall ſins, and are liable to temporall corrections, (though not eternall damnation) not by way of ſatisfaction, but of caſtigation: For Chriſt which hath pardoned the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will not alwayes pardon the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall chaſtiſement, but will often vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit us with ſorer and more grievous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in this life, then he doth wicked men.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Object.</hi> If you object that the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications required for pardon, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſin, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 9. Repentance, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 19. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Its anſwered, in an unbeleever it is requiſite there be actuall faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, before he be actually pardoned in
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170650:134"/> heaven, or in his conſcience. But he that is a beleever, and hath received Chriſt by actuall faith and repentance; Subſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent repentance is required to evidence his pardon to his conſcience, but not to procure a new pardon in heaven before God, which is done in one act as they affirme.</p>
               <p>2. As before was expreſſed, they cannot conceive how a child of God can commit an actuall ſin without ſome degree of actuall repentance in the very act of ſin, and therefore if actuall repentance were neceſſary before they can be pardoned, yet why is a ſubſequent more ſolemne actuall repentance required abſolutely neceſſary to pardon, beſide the preſent act of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the act of his ſin?</p>
               <p>3. If faith goes before repentance, (as many affirme) then a man is actually pardoned, before he doth actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, becauſe by faith we are juſtified, which is only teſtified by our repentance.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>Object.</hi> Then <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. might joy in God whilſt he lay in his ſin, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Its anſwered, there is no condition a beleever can be in, but he hath cauſe to rejoyce in God, <hi>Hab. 3. 17. Phil.</hi> 4. 4. rejoyce in the Lord alwayes, &amp;c. yea as in his God his Chriſt, &amp;c. (though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170650:134"/> alwayes do it) yet he hath cauſe alſo at the ſame time, of great ſorrow, bitterneſſe and griefe, that he ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his God ſo gracious to him, and provoke God to puniſh him, and bring ſcandall to religion, &amp;c. Even <hi>Paul</hi> when he mourned under his ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. yet rejoyced in Chriſt, verſe 25. Secondly, if he dorepent without ſome precedent or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant act of faith, is it not the repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of an unbeleever, and ſo not accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to procure pardon? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>10. <hi>Object.</hi> I will forgive their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. ſaith God, <hi>ergo</hi> they were not pardoned before.</p>
               <p>Its anſwered, though they were pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, yet they are not pardoned to our conſciences till we actually repent, nor is the temporall correction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. So then they conclude groſſe ſins of Beleevers, cannot as they conceive, be committed without ſome preſent act of repentance, and the habit both of faith and repentance ſtill remaining, though not alwayes acting, they are not for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a ſtate of condemnation, but are only liable to temporall puniſhments; And yet can receive no pardon in their conſciences, without ſome acts of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>

               <p>I anſwer, though they be broken prayers, yet thou makeſt conſcience to pray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they are the beſt prayers thou canſt make; that is the beſt prayer that comes from faith, and where there is moſt affection; ſuppoſe a child were ſick and could not ſpeake, but only give a ſad look towards the father and groane, did it not even thereby pray the father to help it? certainly our ſighs, groans and tears are prayers; when we know ſcarce our own meaning, the Lord knoweth the meaning of the ſpirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 27. And God will accept of a willing minde, according to that a man hath, and not that
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170650:139"/> he hath not. <hi>The ſpirit is willing</hi> ſaith our Saviour, when the diſciples ſlept, <hi>but the fleſh is weak,</hi> Matth. 26. 41.</p>

               <p>I anſwere, ſome men make too much of a ſet-forme of words, and ſome too little; for he that ties himſelfe to a forme of words, and can go no further then his ſtint of words, neither in private, nor as any new occurrences happen, he may ſuſpect himſelfe that he wants the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of prayer. But ſome on the contrary dote too much upon change of words, as if their prayer were better accepted of God for new words, or new invention; indeed we judge of the prayers by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legancy and invention of words, but God judgeth of them by the ſtrength of our affections.</p>
               <p>We think God delights in prayers as dainty ſtomacks do in choice of meats, as men do in flowers ſweet only while they are new; but in Gods eſteeme that is a new prayer, that comes (though with old words, yet) with new affections; did not Chriſt himſelfe pray three times together
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170650:139"/> ſaying the ſame words, when it was for the ſame thing? and did he not leave us, not only as a pattern, but alſo as a precept, a ſet-forme of Prayer, to wit, the Lords Prayer.</p>
               <p>Many men ſtudy ſomtimes ſo much for new invention, that they loſe affection, method and devotion; and many there be that have good affections, but want invention.</p>

               <p>I anſwere, thy prayers are alwayes heard and liked, ſo far as they are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the will of God; And anſwered ſo far as God ſees good for thee; becauſe thou art his childe; Now if a child cry, a mother regards not, but when ſhe

               <p>I anſwere, a man may grow when he diſcerneth it not, as the Sunne moves upon the diall inſenſibly, <hi>Quanto deſpectior tibi, tanto pretioſior deo,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aug.</hi> The more vile we are in our own eyes, the more precious we are in Gods eyes. True grace like a tree, growes in the root as well as in the branches, and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards under ground as well as above ground; ever the more humility, the more grace, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5. So <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 10.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170650:140"/> 
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8. I am leſſe then the leaſt of all Saints, &amp;c. Some men indeed are ſwollen bigger with the wind of ſpirituall pride, but alas thats but a tympany, it is no growth in grace at all. Again, ſome things are like decay in grace, but are not, As firſt ebs and flowes of comfort, are no ſigne of decay or growth; which God often ſends to ſupport us when we are weak, but when we are grown ſtronger, he looks we ſhould beleeve without comfort. <note n="*" place="margin">God ſometimes withdraws comfort that we might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe faith, as we take away bladders from ſwimmers that they might learne to ſwim with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.</note> Secondly, Nor parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular coldneſſe, unfitneſſe, and indiſpoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to duties at ſome times, if it be not a conſtant habituall diſpoſition, which may proceed from diſtemper of body, weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſleepineſſe, &amp;c. or God may deny aſſiſting grace. Thirdly, Nor ſence or apprehenſion of more corruption; for grace diſcovers corruption, as the Sunne doth motes, (as the ſmoak was in the torch before, but not ſeen till lighted, ſaith Dr. <hi>Sibs</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.) 4. Nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes when a man is overcome with ſome corruption, more then heretofore; becauſe he may have ſtronger temptations then before; And thus <hi>Job</hi> ſhewed more impatience, in <hi>Job</hi> 3. then perhaps he ever did in his life before. 2. There may be ſtronger reſiſtance then before, as
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170650:141"/> 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 12. 8. for this I prayed thrice, that is often. Thirdly, The body of ſin may decay by the growth of that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar luſt, and thy heart may be kept more humble and thankfull; the more hatred and reſiſtance is made againſt ſin, the more grace. Though to be kept from ſin brings moſt comfort, yet for us to oppoſe ſinne, and God to pardon, that brings God moſt glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>2. A man that hath part in Chriſt, may for a time decay and loſe ſome degrees of grace, (though not totally nor finally,) as trees in winter have neither leaves nor fruit, yet there's life in the root, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4. and ch. 3. 2. 2 <hi>Epiſt. of Joh.</hi> 8. and he may for the preſent be worſe then he was before, (though uſually he ſhoots out the more afterward, as men that runs backwards to leape the further for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or as children after ſome ſickneſſes, ſhoot out exceedingly) Indeed growth in grace is a ſigne of true grace, yet want of groath is not alwayes a ſigne of no grace, for grace hath its winter and ſtoppa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſometimes that it groweth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</p>
               <p>3. If thou mourneſt and grieveſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou doſt not grow, either thou
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170650:141"/> doſt grow, (as we ſay the child is grown, when his coats are too little for him: ſo that man is grown, when his graces are too little for him) or elſe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou mourneſt for want of growth, it is a ſin repented of, and God accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of thee as if thou didſt grow, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber whence thou art fallen, and repent,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5.

               <p>I anſwere, this indeed is a ſore tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, and one of the greateſt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a Chriſtian can meet withall, as the contrary is a great bleſſing, (though not an infallible ſign, for a man may have a name in the Church <hi>to be alive and yet be dead</hi>) as <hi>Demas</hi> had of <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> of <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> of his fellow diſciples) yet it is a great comfort.

               <p>But this affliction may happen to a man that is in Chriſt, as it did to <hi>Job,</hi> who was ſuſpected to be an hypocrite by his three friends, and to <hi>Paul</hi> who was judged by the Corinthians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3.

               <p>If all that have been ſpoken, will not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thee, but ſtill thou doubteſt of thy part in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>1. My counſell is, Firſt, that thou diſcover thy griefe to ſome faithfull friend; it will be ſome comfort and eaſe of mind to have a friend to take part with us in our ſufferings; for ſometimes God comforts us, that by our <hi>experience we might be the better able to comfort others,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 4.</p>
               <p>2.

               <p>3. Thirdly, if thou canſt not believe Chriſt is thine, yet reſolve to love and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him; ſay thus, whether he will ſave me or no, I will love and ſerve him as well as I can, I will walk in his wayes, and not ſin againſt him. And this will reflect comfort upon us of its owne accord; for how could I love God if he did not firſt love me? Our affections of love to God (ſaith a Reverend Divine) <hi>are but refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170650:144"/> the ſweeter is our preaching, and our greateſt ornament is that we can ſet forth the honour of Chriſt.

The law is like a glaſſe wherein we ſee our ſpots, but no water to waſh them out, (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid when the commandement came, ſin revived, but I died) But the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is like the Laver, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 38. 8. which was made of the womens looking glaſſes, whereby they might both ſee their faces, and alſo waſh out their ſpots; for it was both a glaſſe and a laver: and this typified Chriſt; If any man ſin, we have an advocate with the father Ieſus Chriſt the righteous, 1 Iohn 2. 1. And certainly if any thing, its mercy melts the heart, <hi>Adam</hi> ran away from God, when he heard the terrible voice of God in the garden, ſaying, <hi>I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, and I hid my ſelfe,</hi> But when he ſpake to them with a milder voice then they came in, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 9, 10. In <hi>Eliahs</hi> viſion, the Lord was not in the whirlewiud, nor in the earth-quake, but in the ſtill voice, as you may read at large, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 11. 23. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I have heard a ſtory of a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man condemned to die for killing three of her children, many godly miniſters ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

O thats impoſſible, &amp;c. But expreſſing further, how God delighteth in mercy, that mercy pleaſeth him, that where ſin hath abounded their grace and mercy, with God abounds much more (or to that effect) ſhe preſently fell a weeping, wringing her hands, crying for mercy, &amp;c. and died moſt comfortably, (as it was related) having had the mercy of God abundantly revealed to her before her death.</p>
               <p>4. What greater joy can a miniſter have, then to bring men to Chriſt? to be able to ſay, here am I and the children thou haſt given me; <hi>are not you our hope, our joy and crown of rejoycing in the preſence of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt at his comming? yea are our glory and our joy,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:170650:146"/> 1 Theſ. 2. 19. 20. But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, what comfort will this be to us, when we lie a dying to ſay, I ſtudied to fill the houre, but not a ſoule I have wonne to Chriſt?</p>
               <p>5. Fifthly and laſtly, the preaching of Chriſt is moſt profitable for our ſelves; for they that winne ſoules to God, ſhall ſhine as the ſtarres in the firmament, and<note place="margin">Gal. 6 8. 1 Cor. 15. ult.</note> receive a Prophets reward; yea we ſhall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 4. every ſoule wonne to God, is as a new pearle added to our crowne, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24 45. 46. O what a heavy account ſhall that man have to give, that muſt give an account for loſſe<note place="margin">Qui ludit in Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra lege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henna, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Hall.</hi> Ier. 48. 10.</note> of ſoules: either through idleneſſe and negligence in his preaching, or not preaching Chriſt ſavingly to his people; if one ſoule be worth a world, then the loſſe of one ſoule is a greater loſſe then the loſſe of the whole world; all blood cryes aloud, (<hi>Cain</hi> could not endure to heare the voice of his brothers blood) but none to the blood of ſoules, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 8. for that death is to all eternity in hell fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But one main queſtion muſt here be anſwered, before I leave this point; ſeeing miniſters muſt preach Ieſus
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170650:146"/> Chriſt and the Goſpel, whether then is it lawfull for the miniſters of the Goſpel, to preach the law, yea or no?</p>
               <p>I anſwer negatively, none ought to be legall preachers, that is to preach ſalvation by keeping of the law, (ſo farre we are all <hi>Antinomians,</hi>) and for my own part, I know none but Papiſts or popiſhly minded, that are preachers of ſalvation by keeping of the law; for we know and teach that <hi>we are not under the law,</hi> (that is under the Covenant of ſalvation by keeping of the law,) <hi>but under grace,</hi> Rom. 6. 14. Col. 2. 14.</p>
               <p>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I anſwer poſitively, that the law muſt be preached as a <hi>rule of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> for ſo God requires as perfect and perſonall obedience in us beleevers, as he did in <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, (though we cannot performe it, nor are we bound thereto upon condition of life) for elſe the defect were no ſin, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 37. 38. God requires us to love him with all our heart, &amp;c. which though we cannot performe, yet God requires it ſtill in us that believe, and it is our ſin if we faile therein; and hence it is that the law was promulgated to the Iewes, two thouſand years after the Goſpel was preached to <hi>Adam,</hi> and foure hundred
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170650:147"/> and thirty years aſrer it was preached to <hi>Abraham;</hi> and thus Chriſt himſelfe,<note place="margin">Matth. 5 17. 19. Matth. 3. 8. Col. 3. 5. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn-Baptiſt,</hi> and the Apoſtles preached the law.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, the law muſt ſtill be preached as a meanes to diſcover ſin, and convince men of their miſery out of Chriſt, <hi>as a Schoolemaſter to drive us to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal 3. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is Gods ordinary way to prepare us to the receiving of Chriſt; for as the Brazen ſerpent was ſet up, ſo<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 14.</note> was Chriſt ſet up; but that was only for thoſe that were ſtung; ſo is Chriſt only for thoſe that are ſtung with their ſins; hence you ſee the promiſe of ſalvation by Chriſt, is to thoſe that are weary, heavy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laden, ſick, broken-hearted, &amp;c. teaching us that legall humiliation, at leaſt is a preparation required ordinarily to the receiving of Chriſt by faith; And thus God dealt with <hi>Adam,</hi> firſt he began<note place="margin">1 King. 19. 11. 12.</note> with a terrible voice, and then with a milder; and with <hi>Elias,</hi> who had three legall preparations before God appeared in mercy to him; ſo likewiſe <hi>Paul,</hi> the Iai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and thoſe in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. &amp;c. had the law preached to them before the Goſpel. The good Samaritan poured oyle and wine, becauſe it was into wounds; we preach the law <hi>that we might</hi> preach
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170650:147"/> the Goſpel. <hi>And certainly,</hi> that will prove at laſt the beſt preaching that drives men to Chriſt, and he the beſt preacher, <hi>Non qui aures tetigerit, ſed qui cor pupigerit,</hi> not that tickles the eare, but that breaks the heart to ſeek after Chriſt. Mens hearts are generally ſo hardened and ſecure, that the word had need to come like a hammer, a fire or ſword, to wound, and melt ſtony hearts; we had not need in theſe times, be the ſugar, and hony, but the ſalt of the world; we have more need of the voice of the Turtle, then the voice of the Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale, to make men mourne rather then to rejoyce.

               <p>2. Secondly that we uſe them very ſparingly, as ſauce and not as meat, and making uſe of what they ſay, but hiding the authors, except when it makes more for edification, as the Bees that gather honey from the flowers, they ſhew you the honey they have gathered, but not the flowers they did fly upon, or as the Cowes that feed upon the ſweet flowers in ſpring time, as the Cowſlips, dayſes and Primroſes, and the like, and they give you all their ſweetneſſe in their milk, (<hi>Attamen occultum redolent in lacte ſapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem</hi>) though they ſhow you not the flowers<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Featly.</hi>

               <p>I ſpeak not againſt uſe of arts and ſciences, humane Authors and tongues, which are as great helpes to open the Scriptures, but the abuſe; I know well if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the ditch; and truly we cannot ſay of many in our dayes, much learning hath made them mad, but want of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath made them bold and proud; of whom I may ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity is laid upon them (for perhaps they know not elſe how to live) but yet if not gifted and called, wo be to them if they preach the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>There are five helpes to enable us to preach Chriſt plainly and clearly.</p>
               <p>1. Competent learning, <hi>John 3. 10. Art thou a teacher in</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and knoweſt not theſe things?</hi> A blind ſeer is a ſolaeciſme, but he that hath not an eye to ſee, may have an hand to work; ſuch may be fit for the flaile or rake, but not the pulpit; ſome like young <hi>Eliphaz</hi> begin ſo rawly without being well ſtored that they are ſoon ſpent, like green wood that ſmoakes away into ſmoke and darkneſſe; and how can they expect it otherwiſe? except God ſhould increaſe that little oyle in the cruſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly, as he did the widdows; ſuch
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:170650:152"/> as are over haſtily ripe like <hi>Jonas</hi> gourd likely quickly wither; And, like young Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas they may be full, yea ready to burſt if they vent not, but tis with winde, they ſow the wind, and reap the whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind. But a miniſter like a good houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, ſhould not content himſelfe with a few baskets full of broken meat, but ſhould be able to bring forth out of his treaſure both new and old; and at leaſt ſhould have a competent meaſure of skill both in the tongues and arts which are as keyes to unlocke the Scriptures: Skill in the originals is required, becauſe elſe we ſhall ſee with other mens eyes, and take all upon report and truſt; but then we may ſay as they to the woman, John 4. 42. <hi>Now we believe, not becauſe of thy ſayings, but becauſe we have ſeen him our ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. But eſpecially there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red skill in arts and ſciences; for tongues without arts are but empty veſſels, mere ſounds: and if the beſt skill in tongues made the beſt Divines, then a Iew or Grecian might be the beſt expoſitors of the Scriptures; but whether is better, the veſſell or the liquor contained in it? the box or the Jewel in it? the apparell or the man?</p>
               <p>Secondly, to be mighty in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170650:153"/> All Scripture ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> is by inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from God, and is profitable to make the man of God perfect, yea wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Arts and ſciences and humane learning may have their uſe, but the Scriptures are the fountains and the foundation we muſt build upon; <note n="b" place="margin">Eph. 23. 29.</note> There is more light in the ſunne then in the ſtarres, and more water in the fountain then in the ſtreams, and more honey in a barrell of honey then in a few ſcattered flowers: Now it is good digging for gold in the mines of gold; Beſides that we find by experience, much reading is wearineſſe to the fleſh, and doth often diſturb us, more then profit us, according to the golden ſaying of <hi>Seneca,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sen.</note>

               <p>Thirdly, be much in meditation, make uſe of thine own underſtanding, or thou canſt hardly be a cleare Preacher. <hi>There is no greater impediment of our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (ſaith learned</hi> Pemble) <hi>then ſo to make uſe of other mens parts, as to neglect our own.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:170650:153"/>

               <p>I have beene the larger in this particular, becauſe it ſeems chiefly to be intended by the Apoſtle, who preſſed both in the words going before, and which follow after, that we preach Chriſt plainly, and not in excellency of ſpeech, or enticing words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 1. 4.</p>
               <p>2. Now a ſecond thing required in<note place="margin">2 Painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> the manner of our preaching the Goſpell
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:170650:154"/> of Chriſt is to preach Chriſt painfully, to be labourers not loyterers, to ſpend and be ſpent for them, to be like a candle that waſtes and conſumes it ſelfe to give light to others.</p>
               <p>Which conſiſts in two things. 1.

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:170650:168"/> have ever ſounded in their eares; The Goſpell is hid from their eyes, and they are left blindfolded by the god of this world, to their eternall deſtruction, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. 4. being ſtrangers from the Covenant of promiſe, having no hope and without God in the world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p>Yea it is not above an hundred and odde years ago, ſince <hi>England</hi> was in darkneſſe and a ſinke of Idolatry, and therein our forefathers lived and died, witneſſe Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
